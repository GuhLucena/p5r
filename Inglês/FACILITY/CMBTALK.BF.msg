[s]Rejoice, Inmate![n][w][e]
[s]We're adding another fusion type to[n]make sure a "fool" like you won't fail[n]in his rehabilitation.[n][w][e]
[s]It's called Guillotine Search.[n][w][e]

[msg msg_cmbtalk_kensaku_1st_ [Justine]]
[s]Instead of the normal method, you select[n]your desired Persona first, then learn[n]which to sacrifice...[n][w][e]
[s]Please rely on this fusion type if you[n]feel it will be beneficial to you.[n][w][e]

[msg msg_cmbtalk_syokei_1st [Caroline]]
[s]You better be thankful, Inmate![n][w][e]
[s]We'll explain fusion in a way even[n]a cretin like you can understand.[n][w][e]
[s]Now then, fusion is a ritual by which[n]you kill your old self in order to give[n]birth to a new one...[n][w][e]
[s]Basically, you're gonna execute multiple[n]Personas to make a brand new Persona[n]with their blood.[n][w][e]

[msg msg_cmbtalk_syokei_1st_2 [Justine]]
[s]Each Persona belongs to an arcana,[n]which in turn governs both how they[n]can be combined and the end result.[n][w][e]
[s]By the way, as you are executing[n]multiple to create one Persona,[n]your stock will decrease.[n][w][e]
[s]Please do not forget that.[n][w][e]

[msg msg_cmbtalk_zensyo_1st [Caroline]]
[s]Rejoice, Inmate![n][w][e]
[s]Thanks to our generosity, we've decided[n]to permit you to use the Persona[n]Compendium.[n][w][e]
[s]It's a wonderful tool that lets you[n]register and store the data of any[n]Persona you've obtained.[n][w][e]
[s]We can then summon registered[n]Personas for you as many times[n]as your heart desires.[n][w][e]
[s]Oh, and you can overwrite the states of[n]registered Personas at any time. Don't[n]forget that.[n][w][e]

[msg msg_cmbtalk_zensyo_1st_2 [Justine]]
[s]However, there is a requisite fee for use[n]of this service.[n][w][e]
[s]The stronger the Persona you wish to[n]summon, the higher the fee shall[n]become. Please keep that in mind.[n][w][e]

[msg msg_cmbtalk_dokubou_1st [Caroline]]
[s]Bow down to us, Inmate![n][w][e]
[s]As a reward for your hard work, we've[n]decide to let you to use the solitary[n]confinement cell![n][w][e]
[s]Putting a Persona in Lockdown there[n]lets you power it up without having to[n]actually fight with it![n][w][e]
[s]Oh, and your Persona'll grow more[n]the longer it stays in Lockdown![n][w][e]

[msg msg_cmbtalk_dokubou_1st_ [Justine]]
[s]However, a Persona left in Lockdown[n]for too long will fade away into[n]nothingness.[n][w][e]
[s]To help alleviate your worry, we shall[n]keep a record of how long your Persona[n]has been in Lockdown.[n][w][e]
[s]Furthermore, we will inform you if your[n]Persona in Lockdown is in danger of[n]disappearing.[n][w][e]
