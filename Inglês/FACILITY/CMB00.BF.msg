[s][bup 0 201 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5001 0 0]*chuckle* Do not worry. Personas[n]are born of the inner self...[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 201 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5002 0 0]By discarding your old identity, you[n]give way to a new one. Hence, we[n]call that process "execution."[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 201 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5003 0 0]Think of it as the fusion of your Personas.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 201 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5004 0 0]Now then, let us try an actual Persona[n]fusion.[n][w][e]

[msg CMB00_MSG_005 [Igor]]
[s][bup 0 201 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5005 0 0]To start, select the first Persona you wish[n]to fuse.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 201 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5006 0 0]Now before you select the second[n]Persona, allow me to tell you something[n]greatly important.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 201 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5007 0 0]Do you remember how I mentioned[n]forming bonds with Confidants?[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 201 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5008 0 0]Personas are the power of the heart...[n]The stronger those bonds, the stronger[n]your Personas will be.[n][w][e]

[msg CMB00_MSG_015 [Igor]]
[s][bup 0 201 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5009 0 0]In other words, the effects of your bonds[n]on execution... or fusion, if you will, are[n]quite substantial.[n][w][e]

[msg CMB00_MSG_016 [Igor]]
[s][bup 0 201 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5010 0 0]When you fuse a Persona that shares[n]its arcana with one of your bonds, it[n]will gain great power.[n][w][e]

[msg CMB00_MSG_017 [Igor]]
[s][bup 0 201 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5011 0 0]This will be a guiding principle for your[n]forays into fusion... Try not to forget it.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 201 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5012 0 0]Moreover, there is one thing I must[n]warn you about.[n][w][e]

[msg CMB00_MSG_019 [Igor]]
[s][bup 0 201 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5013 0 0]You cannot create a Persona that[n]surpasses your current level.[n][w][e]

[msg CMB00_MSG_020 [Igor]]
[s][bup 0 201 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5014 0 0]This is because the resulting Persona[n]would be too powerful for you to handle[n]effectively.[n][w][e]

[msg CMB00_MSG_021 [Igor]]
[s][bup 0 201 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5015 0 0]Now then, check the fusion results and[n]choose a Persona that suits your stature.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 201 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5016 0 0]This is the form your new Persona is[n]expected to take after fusion.[n][w][e]

[msg CMB00_MSG_010 [Igor]]
[s][bup 0 201 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5017 0 0]It's possible for them to inherit skills[n]they normally wouldn't gain.[n][w][e]

[msg CMB00_MSG_011 [Igor]]
[s][bup 0 201 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]In addition, each Persona has inherent[n]specialties separate from their skills.[n][w][e]

[msg CMB00_MSG_012 [Igor]]
[s][bup 0 201 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5019 0 0]These skills and specialties are distinct[n]from one another. Skills are traits that[n]can be passed along through fusion.[n][w][e]

[msg CMB00_MSG_012_01 [Igor]]
[s][bup 0 201 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]However, the inherent specialties of[n]a Persona cannot be passed down.[n][w][e]

[msg CMB00_MSG_012_02 [Igor]]
[s][bup 0 201 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]But of course, there's no need to[n]think on that now. For the timebeing, select[n]whichever you want.[n][w][e]

[msg CMB00_MSG_TUTORIAL_ELECT [Caroline]]
[s][bup 0 102 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]This ritual lets you sacrifice Personas[n]and transmutate them into high-level[n]items.[n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]You'll lose the Persona, but you'll[n]get things like useful weapons and[n]accessories![n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]We'll record the transmutation result[n]of each Persona in the Inmate Registry.[n]You'd better be grateful![n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]Each time you make a sacrifice, you need[n]to use a special material with the potential[n]for transmutation.[n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]You probably have no idea what it is,[n]so take this one and get clued in.[n]You better show your gratitude for it![n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]You should be able to find them in[n]your own reality, too—not just the[n]other one. Do your best to find them![n][w][e]

[msg CMB00_MSG_TUTORIAL_ELECT_2 [Lavenza]]
[s][bup 0 100 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]This ritual allows you to sacrifice[n]Personas and transmutate them[n]into high-level items.[n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]You'll lose the Persona, but in exchange,[n]you'll gain useful items like weapons[n]and accessories.[n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]I will record each Persona's transmutation[n]result into the Persona Compendium.[n]I hope this proves useful to you.[n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]When offering a sacrifice, you will require[n]a special material that has the potential[n]for transmutation within it.[n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]...I believe seeing it in action will be more[n]effective than my explanation, so I shall[n]provide you with one now.[n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]You should be able to find these[n]materials in both realities as well.[n]Perhaps you should keep an eye out?[n][w][e]

[msg CMB00_MSG_CELL_001 [Caroline]]
[s][bup 0 102 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]You can toss one of your Personas in[n]a cell and we'll give it some "special[n]attention" to help it grow![n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]You can only lock up one Persona[n]at a time, though.[n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]And, while it's locked up, you won't[n]be able to use it in battle or fusions.[n]If you forget that, it's all on you![n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]As the days pass, your Persona will grow[n]stronger and learn a new resistance.[n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]That's not all—if you make sure to[n]burn some incense, the Persona will[n]grow even more![n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]If you want more detail than that, you'll[n]have to ask later. For now, get a Persona[n]into Lockdown![n][w][e]

[msg CMB00_MSG_CELL_001_001 [Caroline]]
[s][bup 0 102 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]Oh-ho! I don't know where you got that[n]incense, but you should use it with[n]this Persona![n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]All right, pick a Persona to lock up, then[n]burn the incense! You'll see the effects[n]by tomorrow at the earliest![n][w][e]

[msg CMB00_MSG_CELL_001_002 [Caroline]]
[s][bup 0 102 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]What, you don't have any incense of your[n]own!? ...Fine, I'll give you this one, BUT[n]that's it! No more freebies after that![n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]Now, pick a Persona to lock up, then[n]burn the incense! You'll see the effects[n]in only a couple days![n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 100 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]You can lock one of your Personas[n]in a cell where it will undergo[n]special training to help it grow.[n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]However, you can only lock up[n]one Persona at a time.[n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]Please note that the Persona will be[n]unavailable for battle or fusions while[n]it is locked up.[n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]As the days pass, your Persona will grow[n]stronger and learn a new resistance.[n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]Not only that, but you can increase the[n]rate of growth by burning incense.[n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]If you wish to know more, please ask[n]at a later time. For now, try placing[n]a Persona into Lockdown.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 102 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]All right, with that done, all you gotta do[n]now is wait. But don't leave it alone for[n]too long![n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]The Persona is a part of your heart.[n]If it stays away from you for too long,[n]it could disappear.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 100 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]And now, you must wait until the training[n]is completed—however, it is dangerous[n]to leave the Persona be for too long.[n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]A Persona is still a part of your heart...[n]If you are separated from it for too long,[n]it may very well disappear.[n][w][e]
