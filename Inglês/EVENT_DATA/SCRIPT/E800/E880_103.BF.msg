[s][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]The Medjed homepage has posted[n]a declaration of victory and an[n]announcement of their next crime.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]This is thought to be yet another[n]provocation against the Phantom[n]Thieves, who have yet to respond.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]It seems we'll continue to have[n]localized torrential rainstorms[n]all through next week.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]If you're heading outside, be prepared[n]for sudden changes in the weather.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][vp 1 0 0 1 0 0]There's still no response from the[n]Phantom Thieves to Medjed. What[n]do you make of this?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 9 0 2 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 2 0 0]Most likely, the Phantom Thieves[n]simply don't have the means of[n]confronting them.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 3 0 0]After all, Medjed is quite different from[n]anyone they've gone up against thus far.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 4 0 0]It seems their best option is to reveal[n]their identities before more people[n]are needlessly harmed.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][vp 1 0 0 7 0 0]The Phantom Thieves shocked the[n]world by silencing a globally notorious[n]hacktivist group.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 8 0 0]Their popularity goes beyond our own[n]borders, with foreign media following[n]them closely as well.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
