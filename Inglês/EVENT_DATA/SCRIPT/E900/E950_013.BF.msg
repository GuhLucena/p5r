[s]I have tests tomorrow too. I[n]should study today...[n][w][e]
[s]......?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_000_5_0 [Ann]]
[s]Hi, I'm coming in.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_000_5_0 top]
[s]What's up?[e]
[s]It must be Ann's turn today.[e]

[msg MSG_000_5_1 [Ann]]
[s]Sorry for dropping by without[n]warning you. I was close by[n]so I thought I'd say hi.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_000_5_2 [Ann]]
[s]Huh? What is that[n]supposed to mean?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_000_5_3 [Ann]]
[s]...Didn't I say the other day?[n]I'll bring you something I'm[n]not using anymore.[n][w][e]
[s]It was a BOGO so I brought you the[n]other one. It's pink though, so[n]it might not match your décor...[n][w][e]

[msg MND_000_5_9]
[s]Ann brought out a[n]rather large bag...[n][w][e]
[s]It's... an exercise ball! I[n]heard these train the core...[n][w][e]
[s]I obtained an [clr 2]exercise ball[clr 27][n]from Ann.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Ann]]
[s]So, are you busy right now?[n][w][e]
[s]Are tomorrow's tests are on modern[n]Japanese, ancient literature, [n]and classical Chinese literature?[n][w][e]
[s]My worst subjects... I hope[n]you can give me a crash[n]course. Sound good?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0]
[s]I decided to study with Ann...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ann]]
[s]Ugh... I cant... I feel like[n]my brain's going to explode...[n][w][e]
[s]How do I even read this? Sometimes[n]the sentences start at the front,[n]and sometimes from the back...[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_004_0_0 top]
[s]I know what you mean.[e]
[s]It's a difference in culture.[e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ann]]
[s]Yeah... I wish they'd just[n]decide which direction they[n]wanted to be read from.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ann]]
[s]Yeah, but... Why are our[n]cultures so different?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ann]]
[s]You know, sometimes it[n]sucks to be different...[n]Then you get picked on...[n][w][e]
[s]......[n][w][e]
[s]But it'd be pretty awful if we[n]were all like Ryuji. It's good[n]there's a variety of personalities.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0]
[s]I feel I gained [clr 1]Knowledge[clr 27][n]from studying with Ann...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0]
[s]I'll work hard on the tests[n]tomorrow, too...[n][w][e]
