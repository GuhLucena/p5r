[s][bup 0 3 1 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Yeah, I think so too! After all, people[n]only describe food as salty when the[n]salt overpowers everything else.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]So if it's a negative connotation, then...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]It'd have to mean someone's feeling[n]bad somehow.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
