[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]But the white noise caused by[n]the crowd is quite pleasant, to be[n]fair. It helps me hone my senses.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Don't you feel oddly stiff when[n]confined to a soundless room and[n]forced to face your true self?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]A moderate amount of noise helps[n]me melt into the world around me.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Interpretation depends on the[n]state of the observer as well. It[n]is as though art itself is alive.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]A piece that makes you see[n]something new upon each visit[n]is immensely rare...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
