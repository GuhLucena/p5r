[s][bup 0 5 4 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 0 4135 65535 0]Hm? This art book went out of[n]print long ago... It's quite old,[n]and extraordinarily rare...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Its content is profound as well,[n]bolder than any works popular in[n]the current times...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]I have realized a great deal about[n]the direction of art through this[n]book. The work in here is amazing.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][f 0 8 2 1 2217]It's an incredible book.[clr 27][e]
[s]What's an example?[e]
[s]It all looks the same to me.[e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 0 4087 65535 0]...I suppose that is what[n]it truly means to learn[n]from the past.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]He titled it "He may look scary,[n]but he is a good person." Quite[n]the nonchalant title, no?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]However, the viewer is the[n]ultimate judge. It's not wrong to[n]believe they all appear the same.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Some artists decry their audience[n]as uneducated, but one's personal[n]perception of art is what matters.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 5 3 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Hm... I wonder if I adhere too[n]closely to new ideas in my work...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Once again, I've come to realize[n]the importance of being flexible[n]in my drawing inspiration.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 5 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]This was a great lesson indeed.[n]Thank you, [f 4 2].[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
