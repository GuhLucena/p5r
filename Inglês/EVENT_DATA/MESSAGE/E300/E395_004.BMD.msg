[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 2 65535 0]Now the Nav program isn't a tangible app[n]per se, so tampering with it directly was[n]impossible.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 3 65535 0]But we already knew that to go to a Palace[n]you've visited before, all you had to do[n]was tap its bookmark.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 4 65535 0]And since that screen tap is really just[n]a digital signal, you can fake it with[n]a program.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]So, we had to make sure she had moved[n]away by the time Akechi's Nav started.[n]That was the hardest part.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]But we managed to get all of it set up[n]thanks to that little act Futaba had pulled[n]earlier.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
