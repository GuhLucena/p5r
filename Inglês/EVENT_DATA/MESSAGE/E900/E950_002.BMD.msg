[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]...Hey hey, did you see the woman[n]who just passed by? Wasn't she[n]a beauty!?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]And that white coat must mean she's[n]a doctor. Daaamn, she's totally my type![n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Know-It-All Young Man]]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Whoa, man, step back a sec. She might[n]be that quack I've been hearing rumors[n]about.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Gaudy Young Man]]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Wait, she's one of those doctors that[n]don't even examine you? She just[n]prescribes meds if you ask?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Know-It-All Young Man]]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]That's right. Supposedly, she runs[n]an out of the way clinic somewhere[n]in the area.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]A pal of mine wanted sleeping pills,[n]and he was all happy since he got them[n]so easily from there.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]What the hell? That sounds a bit sketchy.[n]Is she just a quack, or is she unlicensed[n]too?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Know-It-All Young Man]]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]I looked her up online, and she's actually[n]a licensed doctor.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]I'll never go to her, though. It just seems[n]too risky...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Hey, did you get that?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]If we go to that lady doctor, we might[n]be able to get our hands on some really[n]potent medicine.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]...Even though we left Ryuji in charge of[n]the medicine task.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Hm, we should wait for the others[n]to contact us first.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]I tried askin' a buddy who's[n]a doctor for some medicine, but...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]He says he's not gonna[n]prescribe any if we're[n]healthy. It's a bust...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]I'll try askin' some other[n]doctors, but it's already late...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
