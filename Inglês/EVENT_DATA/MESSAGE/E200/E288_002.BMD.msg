[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 2 65535 0]Hold on. While Medjed was targeting[n]you, you chose to deal with someone[n]completely unrelated to them?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[sel SEL_001_0_0 top]
[s]That's right.[e]
[s]Are you surprised?[e]

[s][bup 0 105 3 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 3 65535 0]Then how was Medjed...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 105 2 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 5 65535 0]...What you've said about the Sakura[n]family generally falls in line with our[n]investigation.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 6 65535 0]It appears you aren't feeding us a false[n]testimony.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 8 65535 0]It's still unclear to us as to how the[n]Phantom Thieves dealt with Medjed[n]since their identity is unknown.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 9 65535 0]If you tell me something coherent, I may[n]be a little more willing to believe you.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 11 65535 0]What a coincidence... No, perhaps[n]it's fate...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
