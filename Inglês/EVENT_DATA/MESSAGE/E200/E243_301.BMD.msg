[s]We can still do it.[e]
[s]Let's try something else.[e]

[msg MSG_069_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 5 14]Don't get too excited. It'd be real bad if[n]something happened to you.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_070_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 5 14]It might put us back to square one,[n]but I think that's the only option[n]we have now.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_071_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 5 14]Well then, I will return to Kosei and[n]investigate there some more.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_072_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 5 14]Oh, and I can talk to some of my friends[n]who come to Shibuya a lot.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_073_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 5 14]Mkay. I don't wanna keep dealin' with[n]the cops, so I'll try takin' a look on the[n]net for now.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 5 14]Welp, everyone split up. We can talk[n]tomorrow if any of us end up findin'[n]anything good.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_074_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 5 14]And where exactly should we gather[n]tomorrow? I suggest somewhere[n]inconspicuous.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_075_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 5 14]Hm, it should be a place we can[n]tell secrets... How about karaoke?[n]It should be nice and cheap too.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_076_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 5 14]Ah yes, that will be helpful. They have[n]a "hustle hour" promotion there, yes?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_077_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 5 14]...Dude, it's happy hour. Why'd it[n]be hustle...?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
