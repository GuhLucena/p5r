[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 4 65535 0]Do you think there was some kinda[n]connection between my mom's cognitive[n]psience research and Dr. Maruki's?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 9 810 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 5 65535 0]After he crushed Maruki's chance at[n]researching the field, he had his own[n]pawns do it for him instead...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 6 65535 0]Although, I doubt Shido's researchers[n]knew anything about the subject in the[n]way Maruki did.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 7 65535 0]...That sounds exactly like the kind[n]of plan that man would scheme up.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 11 65535 0]That being that appeared near the end[n]was most likely Maruki's Persona.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 2 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 13 65535 0]Lady Lavenza did tell us that reality[n]and Mementos were merged together[n]during that time...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 14 65535 0]As you've all seen for yourselves, a full[n]awakening to a Persona can't happen[n]unless you're within the Metaverse.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 15 65535 0]That would mean Maruki really did[n]awaken to his Persona in that video.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
