[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 3 65535 0]It was a counseling session I had with[n]Dr. Maruki.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 4 65535 0]It was just after Kasumi... after my[n]sister passed away.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 4 103 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 7 65535 0]Okay, but I've been wondering[n]something...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 8 65535 0]So it was only Sumire who believed[n]that she was Kasumi, right?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 9 65535 0]I assumed someone in your family or one[n]of your friends would've noticed you[n]going by the wrong name right away...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 8 100 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 11 65535 0]It might be more accurate to say you[n]misheard or misunderstood the[n]name you were being called.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 12 65535 0]Like, everyone kept callin' you "Sumire,"[n]but your cognition made you hear it as[n]"Kasumi."[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
