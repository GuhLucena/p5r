[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Middle-Aged Teacher]]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 2 5 0]Now, nothing's been decided as of yet...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 3 5 0]But at the rate that things are going,[n]Yoshizawa-san's honor status could[n]possibly be revoked.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 4 5 0]Something so serious should, of course,[n]be brought to the attention of both[n]her parents and yourself.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 216 3 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 5 65535 0]I've been told that her results at the[n]latest meet were quite laudable...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 6 65535 0]Isn't revoking her status as an honor[n]student a bit of an overreaction on[n]the school's part?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Middle-Aged Teacher]]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 7 5 0]I understand how you feel, but...[n]Well, third place doesn't really[n]cut it in this case...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 8 5 0]She needs to attain first-place results[n]for her exceptional status to be[n]worthwhile.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Middle-Aged Teacher]]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 9 5 0]Don't get me wrong here. Personally,[n]I think her results are impressive, but...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 10 5 0]I suppose the argument could be made[n]that if she's going to represent Shujin and[n]receive special treatment, it's not enough.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Middle-Aged Teacher]]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 11 5 0]Please don't shoot the messenger here,[n]okay? This is necessary to guarantee[n]fairness across the entire student body.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 12 5 0]It's not as if you've been expelled or the[n]like. Another meet's coming soon—please[n]try for the results the school wants to see.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 216 3 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 13 65535 0]Sir, putting excessive expectations on[n]Yoshizawa-san will only be to her[n]detriment.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Middle-Aged Teacher]]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 14 5 0]Oh, that wasn't at all my intention![n]I just wanted to give her a little[n]encouragement.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Middle-Aged Teacher]]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 15 5 0]Dr. Maruki, please continue serving[n]the student body as counselor and[n]providing support to Yoshizawa-san.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 16 5 0]This meeting was merely meant to[n]express how the entire faculty will[n]be supporting her.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 17 5 0]That's the reason I had you sit in today,[n]Dr. Maruki.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 216 3 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 18 65535 0]Supporting her... I see.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Middle-Aged Teacher]]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 19 5 0]At any rate, that's all I wanted to[n]discuss with you today.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 20 5 0]Please keep in mind, these changes are[n]all hypothetical—unless Yoshizawa-san[n]doesn't provide better results.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
