[s][bup 0 6 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]One of the VIPs is an influential politician[n]by the name of Ooe.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]He's supposedly seen at the restaurant[n]at night and sits at a table near the[n]window.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 5 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Next is my intelligence. It seems the[n]president of a television station is also[n]a VIP.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]He always plays slots at night. It would[n]seem he spends his money quite lavishly.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Supposedly one of the VIPs is the[n]president of an IT company.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]I've heard that he's cautious, so it's[n]probably best if we check the other[n]VIPs first.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
