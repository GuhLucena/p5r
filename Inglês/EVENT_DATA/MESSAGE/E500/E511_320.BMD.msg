[s][bup 0 9 10 65535 1][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 4 65535 0]First, regarding Maruki himself...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 5 65535 0]He's been researching "the treatment[n]of patients through changes in their[n]cognitions" since his college years...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 9 10 65535 1][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 7 65535 0]Maruki's work apparently had enough[n]investors that he was planning to break[n]ground on a research facility somewhere.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 9 13 65535 1][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 8 65535 0]...and as you know, those plans never[n]came to fruition—his funding was cut off[n]and his research was ended for him.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[sel SEL_005_0_0 top]

[s][bup 0 9 10 65535 1][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 11 65535 0]What was the purpose of his research[n]into cognitive psience? Doesn't it feel[n]like there's more to the story?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 12 65535 0]For example... Maybe his research[n]was stymied by someone else for[n]their own reasons.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
