[s][bup 0 221 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Ah, rightâ€”it's the cognition of one's self,[n]which everyone has inside themselves.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]When the flavor gets staticky like with[n]these, that means the self is uncertain[n]of its own cognition.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Can people really not know what they[n]are? Is everyone like that?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 221 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]I don't get it. This is nothing like what[n]I'd been taught...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]But I can't quit my studies now.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]I should move out now. Good job.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
