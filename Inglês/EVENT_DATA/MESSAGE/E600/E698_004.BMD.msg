[s][vp 8 0 0 0 5 0]I dunno if that's such a good idea...[n]I hear that you shouldn't go near the[n]PE faculty office.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 5 0]People say you can hear weird sounds,[n]like screaming, even though no one's[n]there...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Excited Girl]]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 4 0]What? That's probably just a rumor[n]spread by fans to scare the competition.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][vp 8 0 0 0 5 0]I find it calming. I get a lot of reading[n]done whenever it rains.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Melancholy Student]]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 4 0]I have heard that rain helps you focus[n]when studying.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Languid Girl]]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 5 0]She tries to hide them behind her[n]textbook, but it's no use. I mean,[n]is she really that unmotivated?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Rumor-Loving Girl]]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 4 0]And no amount of makeup can hide[n]those circles under her eyes. What[n]could she be doing at night?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 4 0]I mean, she seems pretty dull during[n]the day, but maybe there's another side[n]to her we don't know.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][vp 8 0 0 0 4 0]No way, that was the Phantom Thieves[n]sending a message![n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 4 0]"Wake up, people. It's time to atone!"[n]Or something like that.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
