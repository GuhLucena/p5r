[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Welcome to Shinmyoji. I'm surprised to[n]see someone of such a young age here.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]So, what is your reason for coming?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[sel SEL_001_0_0 top]
[s]I don't know.[e]
[s]Just because.[e]
[s]I'm here to train.[e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Priest]]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Ah, not a problem at all...[n]By humbly accepting that you don't[n]know, you become enlightened.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Priest]]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Ah, then this "just because" must be[n]fate. You were destined to come here.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]We're in the middle of the downtown[n]district. And yet, it is quite silent, is it not?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Strangely enough, all of the problems[n]and loud noises from the outside[n]don't reach us here.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]There are quite a few people that come[n]here to find out who they truly are,[n]within the unforgiving world they live in.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Priest]]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Especially for sensitive young kids[n]like you, it must feel like life is always[n]running you down.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Spend some time here and relax.[n]Perhaps you can discover what kind[n]of person you really are...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Maybe it'll have something to do with[n]your Persona. You should give it a try.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
