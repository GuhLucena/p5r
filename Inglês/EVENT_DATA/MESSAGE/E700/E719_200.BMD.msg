[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Can you tell me the four types of[n]elections? Popular, equality, direct,[n]and... the last one is?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 112 1 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 0 20023 65535 0]That's correct. No one is obliged to[n]reveal who they voted for. It protects[n]the freedom of voting.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]This was supposed to be a difficult[n]question but it appears to have been[n]too easy for you.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 112 2 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 0 20027 65535 0]...Wrong. The last one is "secret ballot."[n]It protects the voter's freedom to vote.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]For someone who wants to become[n]a politician, you don't seem to know[n]much about politics.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 0 20103 65535 0]That is all for today. Go home.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
