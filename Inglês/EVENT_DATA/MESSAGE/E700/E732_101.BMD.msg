[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 2 65535 0]The gist is, don't go around talking about[n]the incident. That's all.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 6 65535 0]Honestly, it still doesn't feel[n]real. I guess people can have[n]multiple sides to them...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 13 65535 0]I mean, if you think about how[n]gods and monsters in myths were[n]first based on the human image...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 14 65535 0]...If you actually saw one of those[n]personalities with your own eyes,[n]it might look like a monster.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
