[s][bup 0 9 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]But there are different kinds of heroes,[n]of course. Different stances they define[n]themselves by.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]For example, one may stick to the vision[n]of justice they believe in, even if others[n]deny it...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]While another may simply do as others[n]desire of them, seeking to be recognized[n]and gratified as a hero.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s]Sticking to your justice.[e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]But if nobody else wants the justice[n]they fight for, isn't that just blind[n]self-righteousness?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]But I suppose that's fair. After all, if this[n]"justice" isn't something people want,[n]then it's just empty self-righteousness.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]I suppose if you're fighting for a justice[n]nobody really wants, then it's just blind[n]self-righteousness in the end.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
