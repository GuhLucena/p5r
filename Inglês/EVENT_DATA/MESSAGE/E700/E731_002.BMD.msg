[s][bup 0 304 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 0 37202 65535 0]I was talking to my friends from overseas[n]recently. They keep introducing me to[n]new slang I've never even heard of.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]Well, English slang is constantly evolving[n]with the times.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]Textbook English is more static.[n]It's so lame...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]But sometimes you can work out the[n]meanings behind slang through context[n]clues.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 304 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Some are just natural extensions of[n]English-language constructs that have[n]already been in place for years.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]Others might combine normal words,[n]or use more common phrases in[n]new or unusual ways.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]Take "thirsty," for instance. Ordinarily,[n]it describes a need for a drink. That's[n]a pretty serious need, right?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]But as slang, it describes someone who's[n]a little too desperate. Like a boy who[n]won't stop asking you out...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]Oh, and "hangry"! That's when you're[n]so hungry, it puts you on edge, and[n]everything makes you mad.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 304 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 0 37207 65535 0]So here's a test! Mr. [f 4 1]![n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]Would you say you're feeling a little...[n]salty?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]What would "salty" mean if used in[n]the slang sense?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 304 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 0 37208 65535 0]Excellent![n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]Yes, it means you resent something.[n]Other flavor-based descriptors apply to[n]people, too—like sweet or sour.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 304 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 0 37212 65535 0]Time's up! I can't wait forever![n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]If you're feeling salty, it means you[n]resent something. Like, say, messing up[n]a question in class.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]Looking at you now, I suspect your[n]salt levels are quite high indeed.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 304 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Slang can be rooted in many origins—[n]common words, acronyms, and of[n]course, portmanteaus.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]Have you ever heard of the word[n]"frenemy"?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]It's a portmanteau of "friend" and[n]"enemy." Think something like a rival, or[n]an enemy who acts friendly with you.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 304 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]So? More fun than stuffy old standard[n]English, right? But it's good to learn[n]the rules before you break them.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]If anyone wants to learn some extra[n]slang vocab, I would be positively[n]psyched to offer some bonus lessons![n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
