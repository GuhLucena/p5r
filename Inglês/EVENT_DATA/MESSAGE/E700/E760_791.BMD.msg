[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 0 1170 65535 0]So this manual says if you send in the[n]password you see after the ending...[n]you get a prize?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 0 0 65535 0]...This is a promotion from years ago[n]though. There's probably no point in[n]doing it now.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 0 0 65535 0]But I guess it wouldn't hurt to write it[n]down anyway. Maybe some antique[n]game stores are into that kind of thing?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MND_053_1_0]
[s][vp 8 2 0 0 65535 0]Supposedly if I send in the password[n]shown after the ending, I get some[n]kind of prize.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 0 0 65535 0]But... this is a very old promotion.[n]It's probably not still running...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 0 0 65535 0]Maybe I should write it[n]down, just in case...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
