[s][bup 0 113 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 0 10135 65535 0]So I've been thinking a lot about our last[n]meeting, and... I wasn't completely honest[n]with you.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]But I've decided: I'm going to tell[n]you everything about Fukurai-san.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]As well as the real reason why I decided[n]to leave my village...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 113 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 0 10112 65535 0]I already told you about how it was[n]a small, traditional town tucked away[n]in the mountains, right?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Well when I was young, I predicted[n]a major earthquake. The villagers revered[n]me a messenger of God...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]But when I kept predicting disasters,[n]they started blaming me for everything.[n]They said I was cursed, a monster...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 0 10110 65535 0]Things went on like that for some[n]time... until one day, an angry mob[n]came and burned the house down.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 113 3 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]That's why I decided to come to[n]Tokyo after graduating high school.[n]I wanted to change my fate...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]I didn't know anyone, but I needed[n]money... so I took the first job I could[n]find at a small nightclub...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]I found myself surrounded by dangerous[n]people... but that's when Fukurai-san[n]approached me.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]He knew from a mere glance that I was[n]a runaway who had just come to Tokyo.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Then once I told him why I decided[n]to leave my village, he immediately[n]invited me to join up with the ADP.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]He told me that I possessed a divine power[n]to save others from misfortune...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 113 3 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 0 10110 65535 0]Deep down, I knew all along that the[n]Holy Stones didn't have any powers...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]But I thought I might be able to save[n]people, even though I was a monster.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Or perhaps because I was a monster...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
