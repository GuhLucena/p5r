[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]He's been really showering me with[n]presents lately... One night he even[n]left a bouquet of roses on my pillow.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]But... he would have needed one of[n]my servants to help him accomplish[n]that, right? What a scary thought...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Even worse, Takakura-san has[n]been hurrying us to get married[n]after what happened to my father.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]He claims it's because of[n]the profit the marriage will[n]bring to the company...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]...But there has to be more to[n]the situation than just that.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 7 2 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 0 3194 65535 0]Anyway, I'll look a little deeper[n]into Takakura-san. Perhaps he truly[n]was pleased by my father's death...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Maybe I should start by asking[n]the employees who are trying so[n]desperately to win my favor...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
