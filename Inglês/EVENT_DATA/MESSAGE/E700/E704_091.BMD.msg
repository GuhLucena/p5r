[s][vp 8 0 0 0 5 0]On your way home? You clearly have[n]time on your hands, Yusuke-kun.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 5 0]I'm on my way now to prepare for the[n]competition. Speaking of which, do you[n]plan on entering?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][vp 8 0 0 0 5 0]Your pride may not be too[n]pleased with the outcome.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 5 0]After all, the winner's spot is not[n]simply yours for the taking.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 5 0]I suppose whether you ultimately opt to[n]enter is entirely your decision though.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 0 0 0 5 0]The more the merrier, yes? Hahaha![n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 5 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]That no longer matters to me though.[n]I am going to enter my painting merely[n]so others can be exposed to it.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 5 1 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 0 4181 65535 0]Well, I will talk to you later,[n][f 4 2]. Farewell.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
