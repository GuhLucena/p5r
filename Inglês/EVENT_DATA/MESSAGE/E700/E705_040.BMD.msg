[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Making a blend, on the other hand,[n]is a different story. Mixing beans[n]at random won't do you any good.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 4 3 10 0 10][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]That's because the acidity and the[n]flavor profile all depend on the[n]bean ratio. Pretty deep, huh?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
