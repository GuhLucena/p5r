[msg TalkMsg_EN_CONTACT_01]
[s]Your colleague is in quite the pinch,[n]it seems. Such a lovely expression,[n]one filled with pain.[n][w][e]
[s][var 0] yen should suffice...[n]You understand, don't you?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_EN_CONTACT_02]
[s]Do you wish to save your colleague?[n]Then, you must bleed for them as well.[n][w][e]
[s]Let's see... I ask you to give me some[n]health. It's not too expensive if it makes[n]everyone happy, correct?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_EN_CONTACT_03]
[s]Hmhm... Your colleague is in danger.[n]Look at their expression... They seem[n]to be in such pain.[n][w][e]

[s]You're willing to sacrifice your[n]colleague? Your troubled look[n]is so enticing...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_EN_FORGIVE_00]
[s]You're fine with this? How dry... It seems you aren't suffering much, either. This is[n]boring.[n][w][e]
[s]...I've grown bored of you, why don't we[n]end this? I'll be taking my leave now.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_EN_FORGIVE_01]
[s]So, you don't care about your colleague?[n]But I wanted to watch you squirm...[n][w][e]
