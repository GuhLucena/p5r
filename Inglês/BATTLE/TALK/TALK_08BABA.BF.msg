[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CONTACT_01]
[s]...Ooh, this isn't good for my back.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CONTACT_02]
[s]How could you treat your elders so[n]horribly? Goodness, isn't this abuse of[n]the elderly?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CONTACT_03]
[s]You again? Hrm, dealing with a cheeky[n]child like you is always a bother.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01]
[s]...Now that I've taken a good look at you,[n]dearie, you're pretty young—even for a[n]human.[n][w][e]
[s]You were so sure of yourself, so it's[n]embarrassing now to admit you're[n]struggling here. Right?[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01 top]
[s]That's right.[e]
[s]No.[e]
[s]Don't make fun of me.[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R]
[s]Well, you scared me a little bit. I'd say[n]that's an accomplishment.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_2]
[s]You humans! Always so proud of being[n]so unique and individual, but you all do[n]the same foolish things...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_3]
[s]Well, now. I wish I could speak to your[n]parents about all the trouble you've[n]caused me.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_4]
[s]You're just a child—there's no arguing[n]that. You buy train passes with the[n]student discount, right?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_5]
[s]You're just denying it because I said the[n]truth. Oh, you're a flip-flopper, all right.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_6]
[s]To be honest, I suppose I don't mind being[n]wrong or right about you having a tough[n]time here.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_7]
[s]I guess you're right, dearie. After all,[n]you're strong enough to put me in a[n]corner like this.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_8]
[s]Oh, so you've got your mind set on[n]reaching your goals. Pretty impressive for[n]a child like you.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_9]
[s]Dearie, did you really have to ask?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_10]
[s]If you think I was, then you must have it[n]in your head that you're worth making[n]fun of, dearie.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_11]
[s]I wouldn't worry. If you can understand[n]that much, child, it means you're pretty[n]smart.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_12]
[s]Am I? I'm sure you're usually nice and[n]friendly, dearie, so this must be a nice[n]change of pace for you.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_13]
[s]...You're just giving more reasons to feel[n]ashamed of yourself, child.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_14]
[s]Oh, just by looking at you, I can tell you're[n]the kind of human I can feel sorry for.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_15]
[s]...I thought you wanted to talk.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_16]
[s]...Didn't your parents teach you proper[n]manners?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02]
[s]I know that saying this defeats the purpose[n]of us talking, child, but...[n][w][e]
[s]Well, quite frankly... No one wants you[n]here. You do understand that, right?[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02 top]
[s]I know.[e]
[s]I didn't know that.[e]
[s]Who cares?[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R]
[s]Hrm. It seems that you're not completely[n]clueless, then.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_2]
[s]Is that so? Hrm, well, I think you're all talk.[n]It's what you humans are good at, after all.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_3]
[s]If you knew, then how could you do such[n]inconsiderate things to me?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_4]
[s]So you already knew that, and yet you're[n]still here? You're a cheeky one, aren't you?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_5]
[s]You came all this way without knowing[n]that? Oh, how embarrassing.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_6]
[s]I suppose I don't blame you for not[n]noticing. But I do want you to be more[n]careful next time.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_7]
[s]Well, dearie, don't expect me to go easy[n]on you just because you didn't know.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_8]
[s]I'd be appalled if I didn't pity you so much.[n]You really should pay attention to things[n]around you, dearie.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_9]
[s]Hrm... You probably don't have any clue[n]at all, dearie.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_10]
[s]Dearie, you'll lose friends if you don't[n]change your attitude.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_11]
[s]Oh, that's the sort of attitude you can get[n]away with while you're still young. I envy[n]you for that.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_12]
[s]Maybe you don't care, but I do. Oh, you[n]humans can be pretty narrow-minded.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_13]
[s]Maybe you didn't like hearing it, but[n]harsh words help you grow, dearie.[n]It's for your own good.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_14]
[s]Dearie, I said what I wanted to say[n]because I thought we were having a[n]real conversation.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_15]
[s]Child, if I didn't say it, someone else[n]would have.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_16]
[s]It's not just me who feels that way.[n]A lot of the others around here are[n]saying it too.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03]
[s]Oh, that's right. I hear that you humans[n]have a holiday for celebrating the elderly.[n][w][e]
[s]I suppose that's why I feel so confused,[n]child. After all, why am I being treated like[n]this?[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03 top]
[s]Because you resisted.[e]
[s]It's for your own good.[e]
[s]Holidays don't matter.[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R]
[s]Well, you resisted my resistance. Maybe[n]we won't get very far if we just talk about[n]this, though.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_2]
[s]So it's because I didn't do what you[n]wanted. Oh, you are dangerous for a[n]human, child.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_3]
[s]That might be true, but isn't it also true that[n]you should never have come here in[n]the first place?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_4]
[s]Well, if I didn't resist, then I'd be dead.[n]We wouldn't even be talking right now,[n]dearie.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_5]
[s]Well, if this really is for my own good,[n]could you at least try being a bit nicer?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_6]
[s]I suppose I'll just have to let this slide.[n]I can't get upset at every little thing a child[n]does.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_7]
[s]Hmph, that's rather rude, coming from[n]a whippersnapper such as yourself...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_8]
[s]I don't need anything even close to that.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_9]
[s]Goodness, living your life like nothing[n]matters is how you ended up with such a[n]tiny brain.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_10]
[s]Of course they matter. As you can see,[n]I'm elderly myself. Have some respect![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_11]
[s]So you live your days on autopilot...[n]Well, I suppose that's reality.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_12]
[s]Well, I don't know what I should have[n]expected from a human like you.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_13]
[s]Hm? Was I wrong about humans having[n]that kind of holiday? Well, I suppose it[n]doesn't matter.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_14]
[s]Your world will have a boom in the senior[n]population soon. You better practice[n]getting along with them.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_15]
[s]If you're going to shoot, dearie, why don't[n]you aim at that empty brain of yours?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_16]
[s]I suppose that mouth of yours, dearie,[n]is just for decoration.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04]
[s]You're a human child, right? I'll try to say[n]it in a way that you can understand, dearie.[n][w][e]
[s]I wish I could see what kind of parents[n]raised you to run loose and wreak havoc[n]like this.[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04 top]
[s]I'll introduce you to them later.[e]
[s]I don't think that'll happen.[e]
[s]Leave my parents out of this.[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R]
[s]Haha! Playing along with my joke, are[n]you? Well, aren't you a sweetie.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_2]
[s]Heheh, we're not that far in the[n]relationship yet...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_3]
[s]Psh, you don't even get jokes, do you?[n]What a little dope.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_4]
[s]That'd be pretty pointless, you know...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_5]
[s]Well, I suppose it'd be strange if you[n]carried a picture of your parents with[n]you all the time.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_6]
[s]Oh, I was only joking, child. Hrm,[n]maybe my delivery was all wrong.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_7]
[s]Oh, that's quite all right, child. I'm pretty[n]sure they're just as rude and disrespectful[n]as you.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_8]
[s]Oh, don't you worry about it, dearie.[n]I didn't really want to see them.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_9]
[s]Dearie, you're more dependent on your[n]parents than you think. You're still[n]underage, after all.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_10]
[s]So... You behaving in this way is all your[n]own fault? Well, if you say so, dearie.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_11]
[s]You can't ask me to do that. After all, it's[n]clear that they didn't raise you right.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_12]
[s]Oh, you're really speaking up for your[n]parents? You're more independent than[n]I thought.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_13]
[s]...You don't want me to talk about your[n]parents? You should have been a better[n]child for them, then.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_14]
[s]It must be so inconvenient, being human.[n]The fault of the child is also the parents'[n]and vice versa.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_15]
[s]Oh, child, your parents must be so[n]ashamed of you. They'd be better off if[n]you just... disappeared.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_16]
[s]Oh, don't you worry, dearie. I wasn't[n]serious. Your parents don't interest me[n]that much.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05]
[s]...In any case, dear, why are you[n]wandering around here?[n][w][e]
[s]You must be one of those delinquents I[n]hear about. Do you have poor grades in[n]school?[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05 top]
[s]I'm a straight-A student.[e]
[s]They're not great...[e]
[s]At least I'm popular.[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R]
[s]Really? It doesn't seem like it. Maybe it's[n]because you're wearing all black like a[n]hoodlum, dearie.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_2]
[s]Oh, don't try to make yourself look better[n]than you really are. I can see right through[n]you, dear.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_3]
[s]Really now? Maybe you have good grades,[n]but from the way you're acting, you have[n]no intelligence.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_4]
[s]Oh, do they grade on a curve at your[n]school? You're so lucky to have so many[n]people doing worse than you.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_5]
[s]Well, I suppose you're more likable than[n]those people who boast but have nothing[n]to back it up.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_6]
[s]You realize this, but you're not trying to[n]fix it, dearie? You must like to take things[n]easy.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_7]
[s]Going to school isn't free. At the very least,[n]you should make sure you graduate,[n]dearie.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_8]
[s]Oh, I could already tell just by looking at[n]you, child. There's no need to explain it[n]to me.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_9]
[s]Did you hear that from others, or are you[n]just full of yourself? Anyone can talk big,[n]dearie.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_10]
[s]Well, I hear that's more useful once you[n]go out in the real world. Why don't you[n]quit school, child?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_11]
[s]Please, child, it's people with poor grades[n]who feel like they need to make excuses[n]like that.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_12]
[s]Dearie, you know that being popular isn't[n]an excuse for poor grades, right?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_13]
[s]Does it bother you that I pointed it out,[n]dear? But learning what's wrong is the[n]first step to growth.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_14]
[s]Oh, you're so aggressive, child. I wish[n]you'd channel some of that energy into[n]your studies.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_15]
[s]I suppose you don't need to explain,[n]dearie. You wouldn't act like this if you[n]had good grades.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_16]
[s]Let's just say it's not your fault your grades[n]are bad. Now, you can just work on your[n]personality...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06]
[s]My goodness, you're a strange child. It's[n]clear that you want to spend time with an[n]old biddy like me.[n][w][e]
[s]But I've been around the block, so I know—[n]there's something else you want from me,[n]isn't there?[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06 top]
[s]Nope.[e]
[s]I just love the elderly.[e]
[s]I just want you to die happy.[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R]
[s]Well, that's not the worst thing in the[n]world, but it IS a little disappointing to[n]hear it phrased that way...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_2]
[s]You're giving a serious answer to my joke?[n]You seem like you need to learn how to[n]have fun, sonny...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_3]
[s]Then... Then why are you doing this?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_4]
[s]Of course you wouldn't want anything[n]from useless ol' me...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_5]
[s]Hrm. I suppose I'm a little impressed that[n]you haven't forgotten to respect your[n]elders.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_6]
[s]Well, now. I don't intend for you to fall[n]for me, but it's the thought that counts,[n]dearie.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_7]
[s]If you really feel that way, why are you[n]confronting me? Do you understand what[n]you're doing?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_8]
[s]I don't like it when other people treat me[n]like an old person, but I suppose they[n]mean well.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_9]
[s]Hrm. I'm afraid I'll have to turn you down.[n]I can die or be happy, dearie, but both at[n]the same time?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_10]
[s]Really now? If you went through the[n]trouble of doing all this for me, I suppose[n]I can't argue.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_11]
[s]Hah! I thought I was pretty witty, but[n]you— Your humor's a little dark, but[n]that was funny, dearie.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_12]
[s]Oh, dearie, offering too much to other[n]people is a sign of low self-esteem. You[n]know that, right?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_13]
[s]Oh, were you serious, dear? I'm sorry for[n]assuming things.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_14]
[s]...I thought we were just having a[n]conversation. You really are a strange[n]one.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_15]
[s]Dearie, why hurt me if you want[n]something from me? You don't take good[n]care of your things, do you?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_16]
[s]I guess this is what I should've expected[n]from a simple-minded child like you.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07]
[s]...I never thought someone like me would[n]ever be outdone by some human.[n][w][e]
[s]When I was young, I could make anyone[n]back off—if they were smart enough—[n]with just my glare.[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07 top]

[s]I'm just that good.[e]
[s]You've grown old.[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R]
[s]Right? It's sad to get old...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_2]
[s]Aw, you're just feeding me a line...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_3]
[s]I'm glad you think so—maybe I can[n]actually still do it? Should we see?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_4]
[s]I was able to kill someone like you in an[n]instant, too—I wonder if I still can...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_5]
[s]To think, a youngster is teaching me that[n]there's always somebody stronger...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_6]
[s]...It's true, dear. If I knew this would happen,[n]I would have run away much earlier.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_7]
[s]Dearie, when you say that sort of thing[n]yourself, that's a sure sign that you're still[n]just a child.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_8]
[s]Maybe you're right, child. Or maybe you[n]just weren't smart enough to run from[n]clear danger.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_9]
[s]Well, I've been around a while. It's no[n]surprise some parts don't work as well[n]as they used to.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_10]
[s]...Oh, dearie, saying that to your opponent[n]is a sure sign that you're still just a child.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_11]
[s]I didn't want to admit it, dearie, but[n]somehow it's a relief to hear someone[n]else say it.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_12]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_13]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_14]
[s]Is this your way of telling me not to cling[n]to past glory? Coming from a child, it's[n]not convincing.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_15]
[s]You think that thing scares me? Dearie,[n]that's nothing compared to my glare back[n]in the day...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_16]
[s]...Child, if you keep acting so sure of[n]yourself, it'll come back to bite you later.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_2]
[s]Well, I don't blame you, child. Ignorance[n]really can be bliss over in the real world.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_3]
[s]Oh. I suppose that means you're the kind[n]of person I don't like too, child.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_4]
[s]Hrm. I suppose youth and confidence[n]really do go hand in hand. I guess that's[n]fine.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_5]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_7]
[s]You say that, dearie, but who knows what[n]you really think? You humans are good at[n]lying.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_8]
[s]You're just going along with whatever I[n]say, aren't you, dear? Oh, you humans[n]can be deceitful.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_9]
[s]Well, if you're proud of that, dear, I[n]suppose I don't have anything more to[n]say about it.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_10]
[s]Really now? Well, it's not like I wanted a[n]debate. It's fine if you just ignore what I[n]said.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_11]
[s]Oh, dearie, I told you that for your own[n]good. You'll be thanking me later, mark[n]my word.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_15]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_6]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_15]

[s]Oh, child, I must have been mistaken to[n]think we could have a level-headed[n]conversation.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03]
[s]Now, dearie, if I've got this straight, you're[n]asking me to leave this place and become[n]one with you.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_3]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_13]
[s]Oh, my, just the thought of it got you[n]excited, didn't it, dearie?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_14]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_16]
[s]What's that, dearie? Are you upset[n]because that wasn't romantic enough?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_2]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_4]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_5]
[s]I'm sorry, dearie, but I have to ask. You're[n]not asking because you have some[n]weird fetish, right?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_6]
[s]Really now? It takes so much more energy[n]to scold a child than to praise him, you[n]know.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_7]
[s]What kind of grandchild would request to[n]be scolded?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_8]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_9]
[s]Aw, how sweet—although a bit boring,[n]I suppose...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_10]
[s]It's good to accept people's kindness[n]every so often, you know.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_14]
[s]Well, I suppose if this is how you play with[n]your grandmother, I'll have to go along[n]with it.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_15]
[s]Well, now. Child, is this your way of[n]saying that weak, old people should know[n]their place?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_16]
[s]Oh, child. I'm not so feeble or feeble-[n]minded to just let you hit me.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05]
[s]You know, dearie, I'm hearing that[n]divorce after a long marriage is a popular[n]fad in the real world.[n][w][e]
[s]I guess women are really more social[n]these days, finding so many fun things to[n]do outside the home.[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05 top]
[s]That's so true.[e]
[s]Men are social too.[e]
[s]Is that so?[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R]
[s]Men and women are both quite difficult[n]to understand, huh?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_2]
[s]So you'll just go along with whatever I say?[n]What a helpless human...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_3]
[s]And men like you are one of the kinds that[n]women run from.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_4]
[s]Maybe I should just get out of here and[n]have some fun of my own, too...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_5]
[s]Hrm. Are you the kind of human[n]that insists that men are better than[n]women? That's so sad, dearie.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_6]
[s]I suppose you're right, child. You're[n]spending time with me, so I can't argue[n]with that.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_7]
[s]Dearie, the point isn't whether women[n]are more social than men...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_8]
[s]You really have a point, dearie. Otherwise,[n]I suppose you wouldn't be here, talking to[n]me right now.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_9]
[s]Oh? It seems I have caught your interest.[n]Have you not heard of such cases?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_10]
[s]You're the human here, aren't you,[n]dearie? Shouldn't you be the one who[n]knows about it?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_11]
[s]Really, child, isn't it a fad? You'd better[n]make sure not to get left behind.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_12]
[s]...There is no such thing as "happily ever[n]after," you know.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_13]
[s]Hrm. It seems we don't see eye to eye on[n]this issue, but I suppose I can't blame you.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_14]
[s]Oh, I'm sorry, dearie. Was this too serious[n]a topic for you?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_15]
[s]Did the word "divorce" upset you, dearie?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_16]
[s]Dearie, are you upset? You don't really[n]think a woman's place is just inside the[n]home, do you?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06]
[s]The real world has changed over the years.[n]People used to care a lot more about their[n]neighbors.[n][w][e]
[s]Now, people don't even know who lives[n]next door to them. Shouldn't we know[n]our neighbors better?[n][w][e]

[s]You know, you're a pretty admirable child[n]for saying that.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_2]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_3]
[s]You know, dearie, for a lot of people,[n]loneliness isn't something they can get[n]over on their own.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_4]
[s]Well, most of human society is like that[n]now. I can't do anything to change it all[n]back.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_5]
[s]Hrm, I wish you'd show a bit more interest[n]in what I say, child. But at least you're[n]honest.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_6]
[s]Oh, child. If you don't socialize enough,[n]your manners and social skills will suffer[n]for it.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_7]
[s]Oh, child, aren't you a little bit scared[n]about not knowing who lives right next[n]to you?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_8]
[s]Well, I suppose I don't care too much[n]about my own neighbors, either.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_9]
[s]Ah, that is quite true... especially these[n]days.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_10]
[s]Well, I guess that's true...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_11]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_13]
[s]Hrm, so there's no point in listening to[n]someone unless it serves you in some[n]way?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_14]
[s]Fine, fine. I'm sure this kind of topic is[n]pretty boring to young people.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_15]
[s]Oh, dearie. I'm not really sure what you[n]mean when you do that.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_16]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_07_R_5]
[s]Well, dearie, at least you accept some[n]responsibility for your actions.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_07_R_11]
[s]Well, some do say that fools who are[n]deceived can only blame themselves.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_07_R_14]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_08_R_5]
[s]And what do you think a child like you[n]understands about the elderly, hmm?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_08_R_6]
[s]You're right, dearie. I haven't considered[n]how other elderly people may feel.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_08_R_7]
[s]You're right, dearie. Maybe some elderly[n]folks would prefer to keep some[n]excitement in their life.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_08_R_8]
[s]Saying such a thing is truly tactless, child.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_08_R_9]
[s]You know, child, it somehow irritates me[n]to hear a young person tell me that.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_08_R_10]
[s]Say what you want, but you'll soon join[n]us, dearie...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_08_R_11]
[s]Oh my, is that so? Perhaps the elderly will[n]take the spotlight from now on.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_08_R_12]
[s]All right dearie, you don't need to show[n]off how much you know...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_08_R_13]
[s]Oh, you have a point, dearie. People do[n]age faster without any excitement in their[n]lives.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_08_R_14]
[s]Oh, you have a point, dearie. People do[n]age faster without any excitement in their[n]lives.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_08_R_15]
[s]Dearie... Are you saying it's better to just[n]put the elderly out of their misery?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_08_R_16]
[s]Dearie, I thought I just explained that we[n]old people don't like these kinds of jokes.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09]
[s]Oh, I wanted to ask you, dearie. There's[n]something I heard about riding trains in[n]the real world...[n][w][e]
[s]Some old people refuse to make use of[n]special seats reserved for the elderly.[n]What do you think of that?[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09 top]
[s]No problem with it.[e]
[s]They shouldn't push themselves.[e]
[s]They must be young inside.[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R]
[s]Goodness gracious. You see yourself as a[n]real knight in shining armor, don't you?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_2]
[s]That sounds like the setup to a cheap love[n]story...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_3]
[s]Well, I suppose an old person refusing to[n]sit in a priority seat isn't exactly a big issue.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_4]
[s]Oh, so it depends on how they feel about[n]it themselves? How considerate, dearie.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_5]
[s]I agree, dearie. The seats are there, so[n]why be so stubborn about it?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_6]
[s]You may be saying that out of kindness,[n]but some may take it as rude, my child.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_7]
[s]Oh? You say that, but don't you think[n]otherwise deep down?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_8]
[s]Well, it's not like young people can sit in[n]those priority seats anyway, so why refuse[n]them?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_9]
[s]Hrm, maybe that's what you say, but[n]aren't you also ridiculing them at the same[n]time, child?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_10]
[s]Well, if you can't be young on the[n]outside... might as well be on the inside.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_11]
[s]Oh, that's so thoughtful of you to say,[n]child.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_12]
[s]Do you dare disregard the wisdom and[n]experience of the elderly, child?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_13]
[s]Hrm. I suppose you're just not in the[n]mood to talk with your enemy. Am I[n]right, child?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_14]
[s]Dearie, are you upset that my question[n]was too hard for you to answer?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_15]
[s]Dearie, are you already getting tired[n]of this old biddy asking you her silly[n]questions?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_16]
[s]Oh? Did I say something to upset you,[n]child?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10]
[s]I've been hearing that more of the elderly[n]are dying alone, and it's becoming a[n]problem in your world.[n][w][e]
[s]I think dying alone isn't so bad, dearie,[n]but isn't living alone in the first place the[n]real tragedy?[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10 top]
[s]I don't think so.[e]
[s]Maybe you're right.[e]
[s]Being alone is a luxury.[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R]
[s]Well, child, I can understand if you're[n]too young to get what I mean.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_2]
[s]Really now? How can you be happy if you[n]feel like nobody needs you or wants you[n]around?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_3]
[s]Really now? How can you be so sure when[n]you've got so little experience in life,[n]child?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_4]
[s]...I suppose it's a privilege of youth to be[n]stubborn like this.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_5]
[s]Right? If it were me, I think I'd die from[n]loneliness.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_6]
[s]Dearie, you're always around your[n]friends, right? I'm not sure if you've even[n]felt lonely before.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_7]
[s]Then you should try to do a better job[n]getting along with the elderly, dearie.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_8]
[s]Oh, child. Are you just giving me vague[n]answers, just to make it seem like you're[n]listening?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_9]
[s]Really now? You seem to be around your[n]friends an awful lot to enjoy that[n]particular luxury.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_10]
[s]If you can think that way, it shows that[n]you're leading a fulfilling enough life.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_11]
[s]True, it is precious time of peace and[n]quiet... You are quite wise for someone[n]your age, dearie.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_12]
[s]...Child, that sounds rather narcissistic.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_13]
[s]Oh, sorry, dearie, I didn't mean I wanted[n]to end it all right here and now.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_14]
[s]Child, are you the kind of human who[n]takes everything just a bit too personally?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_15]
[s]Oh? Did I strike a nerve?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_16]
[s]Oh? Did I strike a nerve?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11]
[s]I've been wanting to ask a young person[n]like you about the clothes young women[n]wear these days...[n][w][e]
[s]They wear sleeveless shirts in the winter,[n]right? What do you think about that,[n]dearie?[n][w][e]

[s]It's just terrible.[e]
[s]I couldn't care less.[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R]
[s]Well, I suppose you'd say that. If I know[n]men, they're always hungry for a bit[n]more skin.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_2]
[s]The young'uns these days sure are[n]bursting with energy, aren't they?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_3]
[s]Maybe you think so, child, but isn't that[n]only your own point of view?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_4]
[s]Really now? Well then, maybe you ought[n]to try wearing sleeveless shirts in the[n]winter too.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_5]
[s]Hm... You know, child, that's a better[n]answer than I expected.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_6]
[s]Well, you don't really need to hate[n]something innocuous like that—it's not[n]a very big deal...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_7]
[s]Hrm, and I'm sure that's working nicely[n]for you too, child. Just more skin for you[n]to look at...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_8]
[s]Isn't it? Everyone should be taking better[n]care of their skin. You included![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_9]
[s]Child, are you the kind of human who[n]doesn't realize when a woman's trying to[n]get his attention?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_10]
[s]Don't you think that's a bit sad for those[n]women who enjoy dressing up to try to[n]appeal to men?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_11]
[s]Even if you don't care, girls might, you[n]know.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_14]
[s]Oh? You don't have anything against[n]sleeveless shirts, do you, child? Are you[n]prudish?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_15]
[s]Oh? Why are you reacting like this? It's not[n]like this is a very controversial topic, child.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_16]
[s]Dearie, are you upset because you didn't[n]know what to say?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12]
[s]...Now that I think about it, you're the one[n]who approached me. Isn't that right,[n]dearie?[n][w][e]
[s]You were the first one to show any[n]interest, so I think you should say[n]something to make me happy.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_2]
[s]That's just what you want, dearie.[n]That's not making me very happy...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_4]
[s]Oh, so you'll just rely on your elders to[n]keep doing everything for you... Great.[n][w][e]

[s]Ohhh, I know that's not true, but I admit[n]it never hurts to hear it![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_6]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_7]
[s]Did you think a line like that would[n]please me?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_8]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_9]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_10]
[s]You're not the kind of human who gets[n]upset when people tell you to do things,[n]are you, dearie?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_16]
[s]All right, fine... It's my fault, dearie,[n]for even asking.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_13]
[s]You know, dearie, I don't think people say[n]"hepcat" or "that's smooooth music"[n]anymore.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_13_R_11]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_13_R_14]
[s]Oh? I'm sorry, dearie, is that too boring[n]a topic to talk about for a young person?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_14_R_11]
[s]Do you not get along with others, or[n]something like that?[n][w][e]
