[msg TalkMsg_EN_CONTACT_01]
[s]Heehee! If you value your teammate's[n]life, you'd better do as I say, dearie.[n][w][e]
[s]Why don't we make it [var 0] yen...[n]A paltry price to pay, no?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_EN_CONTACT_02]

[msg TalkMsg_EN_DECLINE_00]
[s]...If I let you off the hook this easily,[n]people might think I'm too lenient,[n]dearie.[n][w][e]
[s]This time, I think you'd better hand over[n]that [f 2 5 3 9999 3]. You do want to[n]save your precious teammate, right?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_EN_DECLINE_01]
[s]...This is the bare minimum! The least you[n]could do is add a tip for me.[n][w][e]
[s]Come now, give me [var 0] yen.[n]Don't be so stingy, child.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_EN_DECLINE_02]
[s]Somehow, I don't feel very satisfied...[n]Was your gift really from the heart?[n][w][e]
[s]Allow me to squeeze some health out of[n]you next. Come now, it won't hurt a bit.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_EN_DECLINE_03]
[s]...You still seem rather well-composed.[n][w][e]

[s]You make me ill. I'm going to take my[n]leave from this mess...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_EN_FORGIVE_01]
[s]Are your teammates that disposable to[n]you...? Goodness, humans are awfully[n]frightening...[n][w][e]
[s]I don't want to deal with you anymore.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_EN_FLEE_00]
[s]If you want me to keep you company,[n]try to be a little more manly next time,[n]dearie...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_EN_FAKE_CRIED02]
[s]Why are you crying, dearie!? Goodness...[n]I'll let you go if you give me some health.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_EN_FAKE_CRIED03]
[s]What? Act your age, will you? Fine,[n]dearieâ€”I'll let this go if you give me some[n]of your stamina.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_EN_FAKE_COUP00]
