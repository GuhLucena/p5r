[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03 top]
[s]Call them. I dare you.[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_8]
[s]Maybe you shouldn't have done[n]something like this in the first place![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_9]
[s]You can say that when you're up against[n]gross monsters! Hurting cute girls like me[n]can get you the death sentence![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_10]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_13]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_14]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_8]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_9]
[s]That sort of modesty is the kind that the[n]most arrogant people use. You should[n]cut that out.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_10]
[s]Gross. Not openly admitting it makes[n]you seem more like a narcissist. That's[n]annoying![n][w][e]

[s]Hey, that view is a bit too extreme.[n]Maybe you play too many video games.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_13]
[s]So wait, it's me who specifically irritates you?[n]I dunno. Sounds like love to me![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_14]
[s]Hey, who let you hold a gun, anyway?[n]I want to speak to your manager.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_15]
[s]Hey, anyone would be irritated at[n]someone who shoots instead of talking[n]like a normal person.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_16]
[s]Why don't you try using words to express[n]how I irritate you? Could you not talk with[n]your gun?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01]
[s]All right, I get it. You didn't really mean[n]to approach me, right?[n][w][e]
[s]When it came right down to it, you[n]couldn't do anything to me![n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01 top]
[s]I could.[e]
[s]How could you tell?[e]
[s]What do you want me to do?[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R]
[s]Then do it.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_2]
[s]Awww, are you protesting because I hit[n]a sore spot? Haha, this is totally going[n]nowhere.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_3]
[s]Ooh, liar liar pants on fire! That line was[n]so not cool![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_4]
[s]Talk is cheap![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_5]
[s]I guess you could call it a girl's intuition?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_6]
[s]Of course I could! I'm totally experienced,[n]after all.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_7]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_8]
[s]...Huh? I mean, look at this situation.[n]This is so not cool.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_9]
[s]Well... shouldn't you be the one to[n]lead me?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_10]
[s]C'mon, at least, like, try and guess what[n]I might want![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_11]
[s]...Can you let me go?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_12]
[s]Yikes! Asking that totally makes you[n]sound like an old geezer![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_13]
[s]Trying to prove me wrong? That's kind[n]of annoying...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_14]
[s]Fine, I get it! I guess you just do things[n]at your own pace.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_15]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_16]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_2]
[s]Why is it, like, always the bad stuff that[n]comes true...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_3]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_4]
[s]Are you making fun of me? Ugh, you're so[n]not cool![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_5]
[s]I guess it's pretty open-minded to not[n]blame anything.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_6]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_7]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_8]
[s]I get it, like, mentally, but emotionally?[n]I can't handle it.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_9]
[s]You mean... because I met you?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_10]
[s]I think my love life is pretty good...[n]I think...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_11]
[s]Ugh, romance is a pain. I'm sooo taking[n]a break right now from all that.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_12]
[s]You think that makes me feel better?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_13]
[s]You're right. I mean, if I met a weirdo[n]like you...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_14]
[s]...Hey, do you have a problem?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_15]
[s]Ugh, forget "difficulties"! This is straight[n]up bad luck![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_16]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03]
[s]...Hey. Aren't you hungry?[n][w][e]
[s]Can we take a break and go eat[n]somewhere?[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03 top]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_2]
[s]We can pick something together.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_3]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_4]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_5]
[s]Nice! C'mon, let's go![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_6]
[s]Okay! Where should we go?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_7]
[s]Oh, but we probably have different tastes,[n]so maybe not.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_8]
[s]Wait, I don't have any money on me.[n]That's too bad...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_9]
[s]Then maybe I'll just eat you instead... JK![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_10]
[s]Ughhh, you're no fun.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_11]
[s]Don't be like that! I wasn't serious, geez.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_12]
[s]Then we'll just go once we're done here.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_13]
[s]Oh, I get enough iron from taking[n]supplements...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_14]
[s]Ooh, this smokiness... Makes me think[n]about fried rice or barbecue...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_15]
[s]Okay, I guess we could order something[n]and have it delivered?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_16]
[s]If you're not hungry, just say so![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04]
[s]Oh crap! Today's the day of the event![n]I hope tons of hotties show up.[n][w][e]
[s]What do you think I should wear? I admit[n]it, I wanna draw some attention to myself.[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04 top]
[s]High school uniform.[e]
[s]Kimono.[e]
[s]Don't wear anything.[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R]
[s]Wait, what? Do you have a thing for school[n]uniforms? That's hilarious![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_2]
[s]No, I wouldn't stand out. Too many girls[n]will already be dressed like that.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_3]
[s]Yeah, but I think a lot of girls will show up[n]wearing that.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_4]
[s]Ah, that's the gold standard, huh?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_5]
[s]I didn't think of that. I guess I'd look pure[n]and innocent, too. Guys really like that...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_6]
[s]Whaat? Won't that make it hard to dance[n]and eat and drink?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_7]
[s]Whaa—? Would a kimono even look good[n]on my body type?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_8]
[s]I gotcha. Japanese-style stuff is pretty[n]popular all over the world, after all.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_9]
[s]Uh, no. There's, like, no way I'm not[n]gonna wear clothes.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_10]
[s]Guys are all the same when it comes to[n]that stuff, huh? You're so funny![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_11]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_12]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_13]
[s]Oh? You're telling me to add some blood[n]to my costume? That's a pretty good idea![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_14]
[s]Hey, watch it. What if I get holes in my[n]clothes?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_15]
[s]...I think I get it. It's better to force guys to[n]look my way than to try to cater to their[n]tastes.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_16]
[s]Save that for the club! You'd really get the[n]crowd hyped with that kind of energy![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_6]
[s]Yup. Only for today.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_7]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_12]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_13]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_14]
[s]You already trying to establish dominance[n]in this relationship?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_15]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_16]
[s]Not interested in a date, huh?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06]
[s]You know, if you wanted to take me[n]somewhere, I'll go with you.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_5]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_6]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_7]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_13]
[s]Okay... I won't say something like that again.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_15]

[s]What? Are you saying I'm not actually as[n]good as those idols?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_15]
[s]...So, yeah, a lot of people have been[n]telling me lately to grow up and act[n]more mature or whatever.[n][w][e]
[s]Is it because I'm not acting mature[n]enough? Like, what the heck makes[n]someone mature, anyway?[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_SQ_15 top]
[s]When you're an adult.[e]
[s]Paying your own rent.[e]
[s]Questioning maturity.[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_15_R]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_15_R_2]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_15_R_4]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_15_R_5]
[s]Ooh, I fantasize about living on my own.[n]Ooh, it'll be so fun![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_15_R_6]
[s]Huh? No way. Rent's something you have[n]to pay yourself?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_15_R_7]
[s]So you can't leech off your parents after[n]a certain point?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_15_R_8]
[s]Ooh, that's tough... But I guess I have to[n]be tough on myself, right?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_15_R_9]
[s]Huh? But I'm doing that now... Oh, wow.[n]I guess I'm an adult![n][w][e]

[s]You know, you say some pretty mature[n]things.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_15_R_11]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_15_R_12]
[s]Where'd you get that answer from?[n]It's so cheesy, it makes me cringe.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_15_R_13]
[s]Well, I'm the one who lost. I guess being[n]an adult or not at this point doesn't matter.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_15_R_14]
[s]...Ah. I guess you don't wanna talk about[n]it. Never mind, then.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_15_R_15]
[s]Yeah. I guess I'll just have to be an adult[n]when the time comes even if I don't want[n]to.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_15_R_16]
[s]...I know one thing, though. Being mature[n]means you're able to really connect with[n]people.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_16]
[s]...Ugh, if this were a movie, right about[n]now, some dashing prince would come[n]and save me.[n][w][e]
