[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CONTACT_03]
[s]Curses... This again?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01]
[s]You just waltz into our territory,[n]acting like you belong here...[n][w][e]
[s]Who the blazes do you think[n]you are?[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01 top]
[s]I feel bad about that.[e]
[s]I'm ME![e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R]
[s]Hm. Appearances can be deceiving.[n]It seems you are capable of rational[n]conversation.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_2]
[s]Yes, yes, that's good. Children must be[n]obedient...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_3]
[s]If that's true, then back off. Your actions[n]betray your words.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_4]
[s]If feeling bad was all it took to fix things,[n]we wouldn't need the justice system,[n]would we?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_5]
[s]You trying to act cool? I mean, it's not[n]like I don't understand, but...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_6]
[s]Haha! I thought you might say something[n]like that. I can't believe you actually did it.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_9]
[s]...Do you know who you're talking to?[n]You do have to answer me, dimwit.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_10]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_11]
[s]I, uh... You have a point. I never thought[n]of that.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_12]
[s]Going through your rebellious phase,[n]I see. Isn't that all just a ploy for[n]attention?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_13]
[s]Calm down! I just wanted to talk.[n]I don't intend on having you waste[n]bullets...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_14]
[s]Good... Children nowadays seem to lack[n]backbone, but there are some like you[n]too, eh?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_15]
[s]You think that scares me? It's nothing[n]compared to what happens if I let an[n]intruder pass.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_16]
[s]I try to have an amicable conversation[n]and you open fire? Just how ill-bred[n]ARE you!?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02]

[s]Are you sure it's fine?[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R]
[s]I think you'll have to be a little more[n]specific than that.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_2]

[s]Fine, but at least do something about[n]that boorish way of speaking! You're[n]an embarrassment to your parents![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_6]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_8]
[s]What, that's all you want? Easy. I'll have[n]'em shining like they're brand new![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_9]
[s]I just said it's fine. Don't make me repeat[n]myself. How many times must you ask?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_10]
[s]I sense a curious gleam in the eyes[n]behind that mask... I only ask that[n]you try to make this painless.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_11]
[s]Yes, it's fine. That is, if you can give me[n]a better offer than hanging around here.[n]Hmhmhm...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_12]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_15]
[s]W-Well, you've made your point.[n]Let's not escalate this any further,[n]shall we?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_16]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03 top]
[s]All right.[e]
[s]A deal with the enemy?[e]
[s]I can't trust you.[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R]
[s]Splendid. I came to you with this[n]proposal because I recognized you[n]would be up to the task.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_2]
[s]Then, I wonder, could I have you[n]answer a few questions concerning[n]this transaction?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_3]
[s]...That's a haughty way of speaking.[n]I'll say this: this is a transaction, not[n]a surrender.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_4]
[s]Oh... Do I really count for so little?[n]A sobering thought.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_5]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_6]
[s]Listen. Business isn't about "who" you're[n]dealing with, but "what" kind of deal you[n]can get. Capisce?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_7]
[s]Don't judge a book by its cover! We're[n]talking peacefully enough, right? We can[n]come to a mutual understanding.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_8]
[s]And what of it? How dare you say that[n]after I stooped to your bratty little level[n]for this conversation!?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_9]
[s]Hmhm, that certainly makes sense.[n]Up until a moment ago, we were trying[n]to take each other's lives.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_10]
[s]If that's the case, then worry not.[n]It's not your "trust" I want. I want[n]for you to look the other way.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_11]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_12]
[s]That is not the kind of response I am[n]looking for! Are we going to make a[n]deal, or won't we?[n][w][e]

[s]Bullets instead of answers?[n]Schoolchildren nowadays...[n]At least you're more stylish.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04]
[s]You... So this is how you treat a foe[n]in distress? Even after you've utterly[n]defeated them?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_8]
[s]Is that so? Oh, my. Is it just you, or does[n]your family share the same condition?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_9]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_15]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05]
[s]All right, let's calm down and talk.[n]Take a deep breath, and listen well...[n][w][e]
[s]What if I was a human? Then, what you're[n]doing... well, it'd be a criminal act![n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05 top]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_2]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_3]

[s]If you understand, then put that thing[n]away at once! Crime doesn't pay, brat![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_5]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_6]
[s]I wouldn't jump to conclusions. You'll[n]regret it later, you know. I'm saying this[n]for your sake.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_7]
[s]So there's a zero percent chance this is[n]a crime? I'm not sure you can really[n]prove that.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_8]
[s]How can you say that with such[n]confidence? You knew what kind of[n]place this was when you came in![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_9]
[s]You'd kill an enemy if they upset you?[n]You're more of a psychotic killer than[n]a phantom thief.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_10]
[s]It's not unrelated! You'll get a criminal[n]record. That'll make job hunting next to[n]impossible for you![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_11]
[s]You want to throw away your life at such[n]a young age? But there's so much fun to[n]be had as an adult![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_12]
[s]Well, if you're that convinced, you[n]should prepare to live life as a convict...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_13]
[s]I-I got it! If I offended you, I apologize![n]Let me prove it...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_14]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_15]
[s]You won't hear my defense either?[n]It's like I'm talking to a mule-headed[n]middle manager...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_16]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R]
[s]...Does that mean you're letting me go?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_2]
[s]I never expected you, of all people,[n]to be cheering me up...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_3]
[s]If that's the case, would you lower[n]your gun?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_4]
[s]Actually, I think ending things here[n]would be terribly poignant. A poetic[n]conclusion, you see?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_5]
[s]Are you always so negative? You won't[n]get a girlfriend yourself with that attitude.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_6]
[s]If I said that sort of thing, I couldn't move[n]forward. Great to realize that at this point,[n]eh?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_7]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_8]
[s]Hmhm, you're right... I'm not counting[n]wins or anything, but taking chances is[n]part of life.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_9]
[s]You say that even though you know[n]nothing about her? I wish I had your[n]confidence.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_10]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_11]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_12]
[s]Like that's something a brat could do![n]You don't even pay taxes, kid! She's[n]not just any girl, you know![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_13]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_14]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_3]
[s]Overconfident, eh? Didn't you know that[n]being unprepared can be one's greatest[n]enemy?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_4]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_6]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_9]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_10]
[s]Is that so? So I should learn to leave well[n]enough alone? Does this mean I also lost[n]at being human?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_11]
[s]Oh, yes, let's go with that, then.[n]It doesn't matter, so let's wrap this[n]up quickly.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_12]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_2]
[s]And to think, if we hadn't met like this,[n]we might have been friends! Hmhm.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_3]
[s]So what does that mean? I might have[n]been shot even though you had no[n]reason to shoot me?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_4]
[s]You sound remorseful, but you still[n]pointed a gun at me. I'm going to have[n]that trauma forever![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_9]
[s]You were driven to act that way,[n]weren't you? Perhaps you lacked[n]good family and friends.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_10]
[s]Then find somebody else! Because it[n]doesn't have to be me, right?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_11]
[s]Me? Treated like a mere stock player[n]in this play? Hmhm, I suppose that's[n]somewhat refreshing, but...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_12]
[s]Oh, you should be the one getting shot.[n]Just give up on life, and become one of[n]those shut-ins.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_13]
[s]You missed? I sense your will wavering.[n]My words must be striking true.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_14]
[s]What? I missed the mark, eh? You are[n]one tough customer...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_15]
[s]A-Answer my question! Can't you hold[n]a conversation?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_16]
[s]In the end, a thief is just a thief, no[n]matter how noble his justification.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01]
[s]I feel like I understand you a little.[n]I've run into all sorts of people in[n]this job, so...[n][w][e]
[s]The truth is... you're a good person,[n]aren't you?[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01 top]
[s]I get that a lot.[e]
[s]Actually... I'm bad.[e]
[s]Are you mocking me?[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R]
[s]I knew it. Then, I guess you'll help me?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_2]
[s]I thought so. I can see it in your face.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_3]
[s]That's what I thought, but there's[n]no need to brag about it.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_4]
[s]Hmhm, you say that yourself? Seems[n]you're made of different stuff than[n]those others.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_5]
[s]Nobody who says that about themselves[n]is ever truly bad to the core...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_6]
[s]Hmhm, if I was your age, I might say[n]the same thing.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_7]
[s]Is that right? Did I misjudge you?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_8]
[s]Do you really intend to stick with this[n]bad guy act?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_9]
[s]You're not receptive to what I'm saying,[n]even when I'm complimenting you?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_10]
[s]Well, it could come off that way,[n]depending on how you interpret it.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_11]
[s]Hmhm... So, it's not a compliment to be[n]a called a good person?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_12]
[s]Then again, I tire of you constantly[n]snapping at me.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_13]
[s]I get it now. It seems this was all part of[n]your plan.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_14]
[s]Are you saying that's how you'll correct[n]my desire for forgiveness?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_15]
[s]I wonder if I inadvertently offended you[n]somehow? Have I struck a nerve?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_16]
[s]Oh, I'm a lousy judge of character,[n]aren't I?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02]
[s]I'm aware you're a minor, but it would[n]be lovely to have a leisurely chat over[n]drinks.[n][w][e]
[s]It's clichÃ©d, but we could talk about life...[n]Ask each other things like what sort of[n]girls we're into...[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02 top]
[s]I like older women.[e]
[s]No preference.[e]
[s]I like men.[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R]
[s]If you fancy a woman you see working[n]in a store or restaurant, give it up.[n]It's a terrible idea, I promise.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_2]
[s]I understand. Older women do tend[n]to be more generous and mature,[n]don't they?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_3]
[s]The older women I know are accustomed[n]to luxury... That can be fairly daunting.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_4]
[s]I hear you. Dating someone who is your[n]senior in life helps you grow as a person.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_5]
[s]Guys who say that often prove to be[n]the pickiest, though.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_6]
[s]What a bore. No one's going to give you[n]the time of day if you keep that up.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_7]
[s]You mean you won't make judgments[n]based on first impressions alone? True,[n]chemistry takes time to figure out.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_8]
[s]Hmmm. Keeping a wide net, are you?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_9]
[s]I see... I think you may have some[n]challenges ahead of you, but... I suppose[n]some things will actually be easier?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_10]
[s]I see. Well... to each their own.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_11]
[s]Really? Oh, I suppose that's a little[n]surprising...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_12]
[s]It'd be just wonderful if you found[n]someone similar in that regard.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_13]
[s]I had hoped to catch you off guard by[n]sharing some regaling stories, but...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_14]
[s]You're right. This isn't a conversation to[n]hold during a life-and-death battle.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_15]
[s]I see... So you'd refuse to share a drink[n]with your enemy?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_16]
[s]Oh? Posing as the kind of rebel who[n]doesn't need women? Hmhmhm...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03]
[s]I'm going to be killed no matter what,[n]right? So, won't you allow me to ask[n]something?[n][w][e]
[s]As far as you're concerned, what kind of[n]person was I to you?[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03 top]
[s]My rival.[e]
[s]Nobody, really.[e]
[s]It doesn't matter.[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R]
[s]Ah, admitting my virtues as your[n]opponent. I wonder, is this my eulogy?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_2]
[s]Were you just looking for an excuse to[n]call someone your "rival"? I admit, it's[n]quite a compelling declaration.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_3]
[s]Trying to pay me lip service?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_4]
[s]Oh, knock it off. The difference in our[n]actual abilities is clear.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_5]
[s]You know, you should watch that[n]scornful attitude of yours... What[n]goes around comes around.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_6]
[s]True. You know, it actually feels good[n]to hear it said so plainly.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_7]
[s]Putting others down to raise yourself up?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_8]
[s]Don't get carried away! After all, you're[n]still just a thief![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_9]
[s]So you're not interested in losers[n]in general... Is that right?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_10]
[s]I'm appalled. You really paid me so[n]little attention?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_11]
[s]You're right. Personal feelings have[n]no place in battle.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_12]
[s]Well, I can hardly blame you. I suppose[n]I don't leave much of an impression.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_13]
[s]Are you saying I have no redeeming[n]qualities whatsoever?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_14]
[s]You even refuse to answer such[n]modest questions?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_15]
[s]The meaning of those bullets... I think[n]I understand now.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_16]
[s]Answering a question with a bullet?[n]You're a social miscreant, aren't you?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04]
[s]Do you have a moment? I was wondering[n]if you could tell me something for future[n]reference.[n][w][e]
[s]What was... the cause of my defeat?[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04 top]
[s]Your lack of resolve.[e]
[s]Just bad luck.[e]
[s]I'm not telling.[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R]
[s]Ah, so it was my determination? I see...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_2]
[s]That's an ambiguous response, isn't it?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_3]
[s]As far as I'm concerned, I don't think[n]I lack resolve.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_4]
[s]I need more resolve, eh? Easier said[n]than done... but you're probably on[n]to something.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_5]
[s]Luck, eh? Not much I could have done[n]about that, then.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_6]
[s]Hah! Mere luck, you say? Then I won't[n]lose next time![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_7]
[s]That sounds like nothing more than[n]empty consolation.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_8]
[s]Those words completely reject the value[n]of effort...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_9]
[s]You're not going to tell the enemy[n]anything? Quite the professional, aren't[n]you?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_10]
[s]I know, the only real benefit to telling me[n]that is so I can die a bit more at peace.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_11]
[s]So you won't tell me. I suppose I'll just[n]have to figure it out on my own.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_12]
[s]A fair point. You've nothing to gain by[n]telling me that...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_13]
[s]So, once someone is your enemy, you[n]show no mercy until they are crushed?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_14]
[s]Hm, you plan on stopping me before I'm[n]able to grow more powerful, aren't you?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_15]
[s]Ah, I'm admitting defeat here![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_16]
[s]Is this the strength of a real outlaw?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05]
[s]Pardon me, but if you don't mind,[n]would you tell me something?[n][w][e]
[s]What has brought you to a place like this?[n]What are you seeking?[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05 top]
[s]An adventure.[e]
[s]Nothing, really.[e]
[s]A killing spree.[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R]
[s]The Metaverse is a place to seek that[n]which can't be found in reality, eh?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_2]
[s]That's what everyone thinks when[n]they're young.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_3]
[s]Hmhmhm, there are things you need[n]before embarking on an adventure.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_4]
[s]You're going to tell me you were bored[n]with the entirety of reality?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_5]
[s]Then would you mind never coming[n]back?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_6]
[s]You're just killing time?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_7]
[s]So you're here seeking purpose, then?[n]Sounds fun, actually...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_8]
[s]Don't lie to me! Nobody comes here[n]without an objective![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_9]
[s]You're a true psychopath!?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_10]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_11]
[s]It's in both our best interests for you[n]to spare me, really...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_12]
[s]People like you are the worst![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_13]
[s]So you... wanted to shoot your gun?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_14]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_15]
[s]That's how it is? That's what you consider[n]a reply?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_16]
[s]Are you angry? Please, don't be...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06]
[s]I've been gravely misinformed. This[n]was supposed to be an easy job, just[n]threatening intruders...[n][w][e]

[s]Uninformed choices are bad.[e]
[s]Complaining won't help.[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R]
[s]You have time to have sympathy for[n]others?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_2]
[s]Somehow, your concern alone makes[n]me feel better.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_3]
[s]Aren't you only able to take pity on me[n]because of your position of superiority?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_4]
[s]You're the only reason I'm so[n]despondent![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_5]
[s]Everyone is struggling because they[n]understand that, but they can't say no.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_6]
[s]You can't defy those who are stronger[n]than you... Well, that's how most adults[n]think.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_7]
[s]Well, there was no way I could refuse[n]at the time.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_8]
[s]Hmhmhm, but all we do is follow the[n]orders we're given, really.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_11]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_12]
[s]Heh, young people sure are pretty[n]practical these days. Cold and soulless,[n]but practical.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_13]
[s]If I knew that the intruders were going[n]to be this kind of group...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_14]
[s]Ah, is this your way of giving me a[n]pep talk?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_15]
[s]You have it all wrong. I wasn't blaming[n]you.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_06_R_16]
[s]Wait! I received half my pay for this[n]in advance![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_07]

[s]You didn't stray from the path or get[n]lost?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_07_R_11]

[s]In that case, how about I make you[n]remember by force?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_07_R_13]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_7]
[s]I thought you'd say that. You're enjoying[n]this, aren't you?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_14]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_15]
[s]You don't know the meaning of the[n]word "conscience," do you?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_16]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12]

[s]Then is it a sign of your inferiority[n]complex?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_11]
[s]Oh. So in other words, I've done nothing[n]wrong.[n][w][e]
