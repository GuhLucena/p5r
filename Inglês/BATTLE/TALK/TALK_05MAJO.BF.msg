[s]Why do you keep bothering me? What[n]are you, a stalker?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CONTACT_03]
[s]Owww. This day really has been awful...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01]

[s]You're not making sense.[e]
[s]What would you like?[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R]
[s]Oh? Not giving me anything? That's too[n]bad. I was really looking forward to it.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_4]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_5]
[s]Oh, please. I was just being a little sarcastic.[n]Do keep that in mind, will you?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_6]
[s]What a coincidence. None of this is[n]making sense to me, either. Why's a little[n]boy like you pointing that thing at me?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_7]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_9]
[s]What was that? Oh please, did you think[n]I was serious? *giggle* Isn't that cute?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_10]
[s]I'm not too picky. Something that isn't[n]as dangerous as that gun you're holding[n]would be nice.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_01_R_11]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_10]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_02_R_15]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_9]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_03_R_10]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_2]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_3]
[s]Meat and potatoes? Your mom used[n]to make that or something? This[n]better not be an Oedipus complex.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_4]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_7]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_8]
[s]Well, I was just suggesting it. I'm usually[n]pretty happy to go out to eat, too.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_9]
[s]Ah, you think I don't know how to[n]cook because I'm so beautiful, huh?[n]Well, looks can be deceiving.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_04_R_11]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_3]
[s]Let me get this straight. You're saying[n]you'll kill anyone, young or old, right?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_4]
[s]...If you want to be kind to me, then[n]there's no better way than dropping[n]that gun, you know.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_5]
[s]Aww... So you do discriminate by age,[n]after all...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_6]
[s]But you don't even know my age. What's[n]worse is, I bet you don't even care.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_7]
[s]The thing is, I don't think I could lose[n]to anyone else my age.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_8]
[s]Then I'm just going to use the age[n]difference to my advantage![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_9]
[s]Oh, I know that. I think men in general[n]are tired and looking for comfort.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_10]
[s]Am I supposed to be happy about that?[n]Well, I do kind of like the extra attention.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_12]
[s]Um, I'm not that old yet...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_13]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_14]
[s]So I hit the bullseye? *giggle* Sorry, but[n]I can see right through you.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_15]
[s]You won't even talk to me before you[n]kill me? You can't just take a life so[n]frivolously, you know.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_05_R_16]
[s]We can't even agree to talk about the[n]same topic. So you didn't kill me, and[n]you're not talking...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06]
[s]...Hey, there's no need for all this, right?[n]Let's drop the drama and just go get[n]something to eat.[n][w][e]
[s]The thought has crossed your mind,[n]hasn't it? Come on, where would you[n]take me?[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06 top]
[s]An expensive French restaurant.[e]
[s]A busy ramen joint.[e]
[s]Where would you like to go?[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R]
[s]Really? Your allowance can cover that?[n]Er, I do appreciate the sentiment.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_2]
[s]Is that okay? Those sort of places have[n]dress codes, and I don't think your outfit[n]would pass.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_3]
[s]Oh, I'm sick of going to those places.[n]Especially with old guys who think[n]that'll make a woman happy.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_4]
[s]Doesn't French cuisine use a lot of[n]butter? I'd feel really guilty if I ate at[n]a place like that.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_5]
[s]That might be good. It takes a lot of[n]courage for a girl to go in a place like[n]that by herself.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_6]
[s]Then, let's go to a place with[n]tsukemen. I hate when I get all[n]sweaty and my make-up runs.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_7]
[s]Looks like you're just trying to get this[n]done on the cheap. Even other guys[n]hate cheapskates.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_8]
[s]Sure, but I do worry about the fat and[n]salt content... I always feel guilty after[n]eating things like that.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_9]
[s]Ugh, you're obviously not even trying[n]to think. People aren't going to like you[n]if you keep doing that.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_10]
[s]I was trying to gauge if you could actually[n]handle escorting a mature woman like[n]me, but it doesn't look like it.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_11]
[s]How about some place where I'm free[n]to take photos and brag about it to my[n]friends?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_12]
[s]Hmmm... I know a great place in Hell[n]where we can drink fresh blood as wine.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_13]
[s]Can't even be bothered to talk, huh?[n]Well, I suppose it's unfair to expect[n]that from a kid...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_14]
[s]So... You don't want to grab a bite to eat[n]with me? You must really hate me, huh?[n]*giggle*[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_15]
[s]I get that you're tense, but you acting on[n]basic instinct is just making me feel tense[n]too.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_06_R_16]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07]

[s]Then can you explain why I find myself[n]so vexed?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_3]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_4]
[s]If you joke around too much, I might[n]take your words seriously. *giggle*[n][w][e]

[s]Hey, that doesn't mean a thing if your[n]partner isn't having fun too, kid.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_8]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_9]
[s]Kids always overdo things. And it's tiring[n]every time I have to deal with it.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_10]
[s]...You don't have to reply so seriously[n]to a joke. Being with you has grown[n]tiresome...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_11]
[s]Even if you're just saying that, it made[n]me happy. I'm sorry for making you[n]play along.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_12]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_13]
[s]...Can't you take a joke? I guess you feel[n]that no matter what, this is a battlefield...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_14]
[s]I can't mess around with you, can I?[n]You're pretty down-to-earth for a kid.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_07_R_15]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_8]
[s]*giggle* In that case, I'm gonna have[n]to get out of this alive so I can go tattle[n]to your girlfriend.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_9]
[s]Maybe you're not being proactive[n]enough. Which is surprising, when[n]you've got enough guts to do this to me.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_10]
[s]Oh, you didn't even need to tell me. It's[n]so obvious. Why would any lady want to[n]be with you, anyway?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_11]
[s]Oh... Well, no worries. There are lots[n]of guys in their 30s who don't have[n]girlfriends.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_12]
[s]Well, no need to force it. When you're[n]single, all your time and money is yours,[n]you know?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_13]
[s]You get frustrated when you don't get[n]what you want? *giggle* You can come[n]closer, you know.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_14]
[s]Hm? Aren't you just acting defensive? I[n]know it's hard to admit you're enchanted[n]by me...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_15]
[s]I bet you've never been in a good[n]relationship. You should be scolded[n]for your attitude.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_FQ_08_R_16]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01]
[s]...Okay, I understand your feelings.[n][w][e]
[s]I lost. Here I lay, at your feet, at your[n]mercy. Just what do you want from me?[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01 top]
[s]Give me something.[e]
[s]Grovel before me.[e]
[s]I don't know.[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R]
[s]Eh, why not? Finding something to give[n]you might be a good way to kill some[n]time.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_2]
[s]You're pretty direct about what you[n]want, aren't you? I like that. *giggle*[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_3]
[s]Of course. Take from whoever has it,[n]right?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_4]
[s]Give you something? You're being kind[n]of vague, aren't you?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_5]
[s]I don't think so. Seriously, would there[n]really be any point to that?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_6]
[s]Well, I could do that, but wouldn't[n]that just make things really awkward[n]between us?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_7]
[s]That's not happening. I'm wearing my[n]favorite outfit today, and I'm not letting[n]it get dirty.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_8]
[s]What? Do you think heads are for[n]hanging?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_9]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_11]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_12]
[s]Ugh. I can see this is going to take a[n]while.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_13]
[s]I see now. You're a kid who just wants[n]to feel like he has a sense of control.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_14]
[s]Were you expecting me to read your[n]mind? Hmm.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_15]
[s]I thought we were having some kind of[n]talk or negotiation, but I guess I was[n]wrong.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_01_R_16]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02]
[s]I should hate being in this situation,[n]but somehow, it's not all that bad.[n][w][e]
[s]The way you treat me, though, is giving[n]me mixed messages. How do you really[n]feel about me?[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02 top]

[s]Nothing in particular.[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_2]
[s]Maybe your approach was a bit too[n]aggressive, but I'll give you points for[n]originality.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_3]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_4]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_5]
[s]Scary, huh? I guess it's no wonder that[n]you hate me...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_6]
[s]You think I'm scary? I'm actually known[n]to be quite therapeutic.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_7]
[s]Hey, don't go around spreading rumors[n]like that, okay?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_8]
[s]*giggle* I suppose anyone can be scary[n]until you really get to know them...[n]Right?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_9]
[s]So this is how you kill time? Provoking[n]someone you have no discernible[n]feelings for? Hmph.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_10]
[s]It kind of makes me sad to hear you say[n]that. You're so cold.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_11]
[s]Huh. From the way you talk, you're[n]better off in casual, no strings[n]attached relationships, huh?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_12]
[s]Wow, you don't really think about[n]other people's feelings before you[n]talk, huh?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_13]
[s]Oh? Am I just a target to kill?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_14]
[s]I guess most men express how they feel[n]through attitude rather than words. It's[n]not a bad thing.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_15]
[s]You don't know how to handle someone[n]with a condescending tone. Am I right?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_02_R_16]
[s]You really don't get how conversations[n]are supposed to work, do you, kid?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03]
[s]You know, the time I've spent talking[n]with you hasn't really been all that bad.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_3]
[s]Just dating? Anything more than that[n]would just be inconvenient to you, huh?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_4]
[s]Not enemies... but not friends, either?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_5]

[s]*giggle* You're thinking of marriage? At[n]least graduate high school first, okay?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_7]
[s]You know, it's never fair to just drop[n]marriage on someone.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_8]
[s]You know, I've already outgrown that[n]fantasy of getting married and living[n]happily ever after.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_9]
[s]Yeah, I guess you're right. I was silly to[n]expect anything else.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_10]
[s]Huh? So, basically... this situation made[n]no difference. We're nothing to each[n]other.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_11]
[s]...Really? I think we would have gotten[n]along better. Actually, it's not too late...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_12]
[s]I see. In that case, would it have been[n]better if we had never met?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_13]
[s]You obviously missed on purpose. I guess[n]that means you really do like me after all,[n]huh?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_14]
[s]I'm not confusing you with this imaginary[n]scenario, am I?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_15]
[s]Is this your way of saying that it was[n]a mistake that we ever met?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_03_R_16]
[s]At least our meeting here and now has[n]some significance...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04]
[s]Ah, what am I going to do? Because we[n]were fighting and everything, I lost track[n]of time.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_7]
[s]What do I mean? Oh, you'll get it soon[n]enough.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_8]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_9]
[s]I can't, but I appreciate the thought.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_10]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_13]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_14]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_15]
[s]I was trying to be nice to you, you[n]know? You should try being nice to[n]me sometimes, too.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_04_R_16]
[s]I think I get it. It's not the result, but the[n]process that matters to you.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05]
[s]...Oh, yes. I heard that human women[n]often trick their lovers into meeting[n]their parents.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_4]
[s]You're just saying that because you're[n]supposed to, huh... It's not like this is[n]about me, but that's rather upsetting.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_5]
[s]Busy, huh... So you have something[n]more important than me? I mean,[n]that's what she would say, not me.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_6]
[s]I suppose it would be awkward for you[n]to meet my parents right now... I mean,[n]that's what she would say, not me.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_7]
[s]But I already told my parents that you[n]were okay with meeting them... I mean,[n]that's what she would say, not me.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_8]
[s]Don't think you can get away with that[n]flimsy excuse. I won't— I mean, she[n]wouldn't allow that.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_9]
[s]...I guess it IS a little too early for you.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_10]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_11]

[s]It's better to get the formalities out of[n]the way early. Trust me.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_05_R_15]
[s]Oh, come on. Would it kill you to just[n]play along with me a little bit longer?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_07]
[s]...Oh yes. I'm sorry to ask at a time like[n]this, but I'm interested in men's home[n]cooking.[n][w][e]
[s]Do you have a dish you're good at?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_07_R_2]
[s]...I dunno about that. I'm trying to stay[n]away from oily foods.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_07_R_3]
[s]What? You can make that with leftovers[n]in the fridge. Why don't you make me[n]something else?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_07_R_4]
[s]Like kimchi fried rice? That always[n]tastes best when the kimchi makes[n]it look bright red.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_07_R_5]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_07_R_7]
[s]Are you saying that just to see how I[n]react?[n][w][e]

[s]Oh, don't worry. If you cook, then I'll[n]do the dishes.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_07_R_14]

[s]Quit it. Let me have this little daydream,[n]instead of looking at reality as it really is.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_07_R_16]
[s]What was that for? You think cooking's[n]a woman's job? That idea's pretty[n]outdated, you know.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_08]
[s]I can't believe that I got led around this[n]far by a man.[n][w][e]

[s]...I see now. I guess you got this far by[n]having the strength to think and depend[n]on yourself...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_08_R_13]
[s]So you're telling me... You won because[n]I'm too naïve and warm-hearted?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_08_R_14]
[s]You're right. This isn't a situation where[n]we can just talk about things like that.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_08_R_15]
[s]I'm getting mixed messages here. Are[n]you encouraging me or saying I'll never[n]be as strong as you?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_08_R_16]
[s]So you can't even be bothered to chat[n]with me a little? Well, I guess that's that.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09]
[s]This is a bit sudden, but can I talk about[n]something I heard about humans?[n][w][e]
[s]What do you think about humans[n]showing pictures of their baby to others?[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09 top]
[s]It's cute.[e]
[s]I'm not interested.[e]
[s]What are you talking about?[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R]
[s]Well, it IS a baby. I guess that's the[n]typical reaction.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_2]
[s]Well, I guess it's okay since the other[n]person has no duty to raise that child.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_3]
[s]You think? The baby may be cute, but[n]what if the parents aren't?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_4]
[s]Well, I suppose you have to say that,[n]or people will get angry...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_5]
[s]You're not? I like it; it feels like you're[n]sharing their happiness.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_6]
[s]Maybe you'll see things differently[n]when you have a child.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_7]
[s]I can attest to that! It's like forcing[n]your happiness on others![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_8]
[s]Then what ARE you interested in?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_9]
[s]...This is true.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_10]
[s]...Oh, this is only the beginning of my[n]conversation.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_11]
[s]...It's not like I'm being jealous of the[n]happiness of others...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_12]
[s]That I'm not jealous at all![n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_13]
[s]I see now. Being jealous of other[n]people's happiness won't make you[n]happy. Is that what you mean?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_14]
[s]You don't waste much time on idle talk.[n]I'm guessing you're good at keeping[n]secrets.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_15]
[s]This is who I am. Sorry to disappoint.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_09_R_16]
[s]What? You don't feel like listening to[n]me talk, huh?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10]
[s]...I know now's not the time for this,[n]but I think you're actually my type.[n][w][e]
[s]How about we live together? What kind[n]of place do you want to live in?[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10 top]
[s]I can't live with you.[e]
[s]Next to a convenience store.[e]
[s]What are you talking about?[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R]
[s]Well, I suppose so. We don't even live[n]in the same world, after all.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_2]
[s]I was just kidding. Why do you have to[n]be so serious?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_3]
[s]How about you stay here with me until[n]death do us part?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_4]
[s]Yes, I agree. I'm glad that you're such an[n]upstanding guy.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_5]
[s]Ah, I totally didn't think of that. That[n]would be awfully nice, wouldn't it?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_6]
[s]Near a convenience store? Don't insult[n]me. If you're feeling ravenous, shouldn't[n]I be enough?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_7]
[s]...Oh, that's no good. I'd just gorge on[n]candy and snacks all the time.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_8]
[s]...What? Are you serious? I guess any ol'[n]place would be fine with you, then, huh?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_9]
[s]...I was just thinking about our future[n]together.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_10]
[s]...You're a real downer. Let me fantasize[n]a little more.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_11]
[s]...Don't worry. I'm worried, too, about[n]how we'll spend our life together.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_12]
[s]Did things suddenly get too real?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_13]
[s]Oh, don't be upset. You won't pay for it[n]all. We'll split the rent down the middle.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_14]
[s]Excited, huh? Me too. Ooh, we should[n]pick out furniture that we'll both like.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_15]
[s]You have no such intention? No, I'm[n]not letting you go that easily.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_10_R_16]
[s]...Geez. I'm just so tired of living alone.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11]
[s]Um, do you really plan on shooting me?[n][w][e]
[s]I've heard that love can bloom[n]anywhere, even on a battlefield.[n]Don't you think that's possible?[n][w][e]

[sel TalkSel_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11 top]
[s]Can it?[e]
[s]Not a chance.[e]
[s]What are you saying?[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R]
[s]*giggle* So you believe something[n]like that really could happen, huh?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_2]
[s]Is there a part of you that wishes for that[n]to be true?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_3]
[s]Well, enemies usually remain enemies[n]forever. Usually.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_4]
[s]You don't believe me at all, do you?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_5]
[s]You know, it's closed-minded and rude[n]to reject the idea without even hearing[n]me out.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_6]
[s]You're such a bore. What a letdown...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_7]
[s]...Be honest. You were thinking we were[n]getting somewhere, didn't you? There's[n]some truth to it.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_8]
[s]If you think in terms of the pros and cons,[n]I say there is a chance.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_9]
[s]I guess if you're not getting it through[n]words, I suppose I'll need to express it[n]through action...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_10]
[s]Oh, please. At this point, you don't[n]need to be so careful with your words[n]around me, you know.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_11]
[s]Well, for example, you and me... You[n]get what I'm saying, don't you?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_12]
[s]Oh, please. Don't make me spell it out[n]for you.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_13]
[s]You missed. *giggle* That's good.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_14]
[s]Relax. Even if we look different, we're[n]essentially the same...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_15]
[s]That's too bad. I thought that maybe[n]you had a heart...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_11_R_16]
[s]...You know, if you're serious about[n]doing me in, you're going to have to[n]live with the guilt.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12]
[s]At any rate, even I have to say this is[n]a pitiful mess.[n][w][e]
[s]I wonder if it's about time I quit this job.[n][w][e]

[s]That's a good idea.[e]
[s]And then what?[e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R]
[s]Ugh, you're just regurgitating that line.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_2]
[s]Hm... When you say such encouraging[n]words, it does makes me feel optimistic.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_3]
[s]...I guess I was wrong to expect more[n]than flimsy words of encouragement[n]from you.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_4]
[s]*giggle* It's interesting that you think that.[n]I mean, considering the circumstances.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_5]
[s]You're right. And then, I'd get[n]severance pay... maybe.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_6]
[s]I'm worried. Actually doing it won't be[n]so easy...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_7]
[s]...What would a child like you know?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_8]
[s]But then, ugh... I'm getting confused[n]myself.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_9]
[s]It's not like I have a boyfriend here,[n]either...[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_10]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_11]
[s]...Why don't we decide that together?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_12]
[s]I haven't figured it out. I'm the one[n]who should be asking that.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_13]
[s]Are you really trying to stop me from[n]quitting?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_14]

[s]Um, let me decide this on my own.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_12_R_16]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_13]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_13_R_5]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_13_R_6]
[s]Oh my, you don't think I was getting[n]desperate, do you...?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_13_R_7]
[s]Then why are you doing this?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_13_R_8]
[s]Then shouldn't we just end this[n]conversation...?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_13_R_9]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_13_R_10]
[s]No need to be embarrassed. Tell me[n]more about yourself.[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_13_R_11]
[s]Do you always assume that everyone[n]is lying?[n][w][e]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_13_R_13]

[msg TalkMsg_GUY_CHAT_SQ_14_R_4]
[s]Of course, I'm not saying to just let me[n]go without me doing anything for you in[n]return.[n][w][e]
