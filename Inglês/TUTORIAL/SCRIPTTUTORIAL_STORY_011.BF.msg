[s]Masayoshi Shido finally has a change of heart[n]and confesses everything in a country-wide[n]broadcast. The Phantom Thieves believe society[n]will improve.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG02 [A World in Peril]]
[s]The Phantom Thieves ride the high of their[n]accomplishment, certain that support of Shido[n]will plummet in the wake of his confession.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG03 [A World in Peril]]
[s]But things take an unexpected turn. The[n]general public refuses to accept the crimes[n]of Masayoshi Shido, and begin to become[n]oblivious to the Phantom Thieves' existence.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG04 [A World in Peril]]
[s]At a loss, the Phantom Thieves and Sae reflect[n]on their next move. Since Shido used the[n]Metaverse, building a case against his crimes[n]would be hard.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG05 [A World in Peril]]
[s]With the public's opinion at a stalemate, the[n]Phantom Thieves must quickly find a solution,[n]but they can't change every heart individually.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG06 [A World in Peril]]
[s]Morgana then remembers that [clr 2]Mementos—[n]everyone's Palace—has a Treasure[clr 27], and stealing it[n]could cause the masses to come to their senses.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG07 [A World in Peril]]
[s]But to do so would dissolve the Metaverse[n]itself, which would be the end of the[n]Phantom Thieves.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG08 [A World in Peril]]
[s]Dismayed that they'll be unable to change hearts[n]again, but certain of their convictions, the team[n]goes to Mementos to do one last heist...[n][w][e]
