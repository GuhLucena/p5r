[msg TUTORIAL_MSG01 [Cracks in the Enemy's Defense]]
[s]Gun attacks can't perform critical hits, however, they[n]will weaken the enemy's defense. This makes critical[n]hits more likely with other attacks.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG02 [Cracks in the Enemy's Defense]]
[s]The higher your attack power, the more likely you[n]will crack your foe's defense. Following a critical hit,[n]the enemy's defense will return to normal.[n][w][e]
