[msg TUTORIAL_MSG01 [The Fourth Heist: Futaba]]
[s]Following Kaneshiro's change of heart,[n]the Phantom Thieves see a rapid rise in[n]popularity. This causes the hacker network[n][clr 2]Medjed[clr 27] to challenge them.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG02 [The Fourth Heist: Futaba]]
[s]The challenge excites the public, but the Phantom[n]Thieves don't know where to begin since Medjed is[n]wholly anonymous. Out of the blue, they receive[n]a message from someone called [clr 2]Alibaba[clr 27].[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG03 [The Fourth Heist: Futaba]]
[s]Alibaba offers to help take Medjed down if[n]the Phantom Thieves change someone's heart.[n]Left with no other choice, the team agrees[n]to the terms.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG04 [The Fourth Heist: Futaba]]
[s]Around this time, [f 4 2] learns that Sojiro[n]had taken custody of [clr 2]Futaba[clr 27], the daughter of[n]his acquaintance, [clr 2]Wakaba Isshiki[clr 27].[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG05 [The Fourth Heist: Futaba]]
[s]Makoto deduces that Futaba is Alibaba.[n]Realizing that saving her could let them[n]stand up against Medjed, the Phantom Thieves[n]enter her Palace.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG06 [The Fourth Heist: Futaba]]
[s]But despite Futaba's desire to have her heart[n]changed, an entity within the Palace tries to[n]prevent thatâ€”a monstrous distortion of her[n]mother.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG07 [The Fourth Heist: Futaba]]
[s]Through the crucible of emotional duress,[n]Futaba's own Persona awakens, and together[n]with the Phantom Thieves, she defeats[n]Wakaba's distortion.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG08 [The Fourth Heist: Futaba]]
[s]After reawakening, Futaba takes down Medjed's[n]website and this solves the case in a flash. Thanks[n]to her change of heart, she has begun looking[n]towards reality.[n][w][e]
