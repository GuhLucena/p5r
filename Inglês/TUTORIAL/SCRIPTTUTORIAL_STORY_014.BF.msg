[s]The [clr 2]ruin[clr 27] Igor warned about back in April seems[n]to have finally arrived.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG02 [Return from Ruin, Part 2]]
[s]Except [f 4 2] didn't die. His "death" was a[n]carefully constructed fake out.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG03 [Return from Ruin, Part 2]]
[s]The Phantom Thieves learned Akechi was a[n]traitor by bugging his phone, but agreed to[n]his plan since whoever he worked for could[n]hide a murder.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG04 [Return from Ruin, Part 2]]
[s]They need to simultaneously prevent [f 4 2]'s[n]murder and expose Akechi...[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG05 [Return from Ruin, Part 2]]
[s]The plan was to lure Akechi to the undistorted[n]police station outside Sae's Palace. There, he[n]would kill a fake [f 4 2] cognition and think[n]he succeeded.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG06 [Return from Ruin, Part 2]]
[s]Inside, the police station is indistinguishable[n]from reality, so if someone could be led in,[n]they wouldn't know the difference.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG07 [Return from Ruin, Part 2]]
[s]By having Sae leave [f 4 2]'s phone on after[n]the interrogation, Futaba could remotely[n]activate the Meta-Nav and have Akechi kill[n]the fake [f 4 2].[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG08 [Return from Ruin, Part 2]]
[s]Through Akechi, they learn the name of the person[n]really pulling all the stringsâ€”[clr 2]Masayoshi Shido[clr 27],[n]who used Akechi to kill his political rivals.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG09 [Return from Ruin, Part 2]]
[s][clr 2]Shujin's principal[clr 27], [clr 2]Okumura[clr 27], and even [clr 2]the SIU[n]Director[clr 27] all had shady ties to Shido. With the[n]truth come to light, the team focuses on[n]taking down Shido.[n][w][e]
