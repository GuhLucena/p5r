[msg TUTORIAL_MSG01 [Using the Fishing Pond]]
[s]Fishing will cause time to pass, but the[n]points you gain from catching fish can be[n]exchanged for prizes. Your [f 4 11 2][clr 26][f 4 12 2][clr 27][n]will also improve.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG02 [Using the Fishing Pond]]
[s]The fish caught are scored on their size[n]and species. Reel in larger and rarer fish[n]for more points.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG03 [Using the Fishing Pond]]
[s]As your [f 4 11 2][clr 26][f 4 12 2][clr 27] increases, the number[n]of times you can fish per visit will increase as well.[n]Try to build your [f 4 11 2][clr 26][f 4 12 2][clr 27] so you can[n]fish more often.[n][w][e]
