[s][clr 2]Maruki[clr 27] awaits them inside the Palace. He is the[n]one that caused this false reality. To help people[n]in reality, he used his cognitive psience research to[n]create a world where everyone's wishes came true.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG02 [Taking Back Reality]]
[s]And Kasumi was one of them. She is actually[n][clr 2]Sumire, Kasumi's sister[clr 27]. Because she blamed herself[n]for Kasumi's death, Sumire wished that she "could[n]be Kasumi" to realize her sister's unfulfilled dreams.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG03 [Taking Back Reality]]
[s]But Sumire isn't the only one—the Phantom Thieves[n]are also being deceived by Maruki's ideal reality. Even[n]after seeing this, [f 4 2] and Akechi go back[n]to the Palace to destroy the world Maruki created.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG04 [Taking Back Reality]]
[s]However, Sumire—who "wants to be Kasumi"—doesn't[n]want that to happen. With the help of the[n][clr 2]other Phantom Thieves[clr 27], [f 4 2] and Akechi[n]are able to defeat Sumire's out-of-control Persona.[n][w][e]

[s]Lavenza notifies [f 4 2] that Maruki[n]possesses a [clr 2]Persona that has the power of[n]actualization[clr 27]. By using Mementos and his power,[n]he was able to twist reality.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG06 [Taking Back Reality]]
[s]However, this only happened because the Phantom[n]Thieves, who held the hopes of the public, wished[n]for such a reality to occur. Upon hearing this, the[n]Phantom Thieves are shocked.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG07 [Taking Back Reality]]
[s]Although they stopped the fusion of Mementos[n]and reality once before, Maruki's actualization is[n]causing the fusion to occur again. With a month until[n]the deadline, they decide to change Maruki's heart.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG08 [Taking Back Reality]]
[s]When they enter the Palace, they encounter [clr 2]Sumire[clr 27].[n]She has decided to see herself as who she really is and[n]help the Phantom Thieves fight Maruki. They all work[n]together towards the Treasure.[n][w][e]

[msg TUTORIAL_MSG09 [Taking Back Reality]]
[s]On the night of Feb. 2nd, having secured the route,[n][f 4 2] denies Maruki—who tells him to accept his[n]reality—and gives him the calling card. How will this[n]final battle, the fight for their beliefs, turn out?[n][w][e]
