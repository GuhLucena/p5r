[s][f 5 14]We've finally made it. All[n]that remains is to actually[n]send the calling card.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Looks like we'll manage to get[n]it out before that investigation[n]starts going down too.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]We still don't know anything[n]about the true culprit behind[n]the mental shutdowns though...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I wonder if we'll learn anything[n]from Niijima-san's Shadow.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]I doubt she has ascertained[n]any relevant clues.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]I agree. That is why she has[n]the warrant out on the Phantom[n]Thieves, after all.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Furthermore, the public believes[n]arresting us will solve the case.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]The public prosecutors won't stop[n]now. They have the weight of the[n]general public on their shoulders.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]If only we knew who the true[n]culprit was, we wouldn't have to[n]fight Niijima-san's Shadow...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Who could it be...? Do you[n]think it's someone we know?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_010_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]That's a possibility.[e]
[s]I doubt that.[e]
[s]I have no idea.[e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]True, but there would be no end[n]to the mistrust if we began[n]doubting our peers.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I want to believe that myself,[n]but that might be a little[n]too hopeful...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]It's someone who holds animosity[n]toward us and can always stay[n]one step ahead of our actions...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Hm, you're right. I can't[n]think of a single person who[n]fits that description.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Either way, we only have one[n]opportunity to turn the tables.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]This final calling card[n]shall be my magnum opus.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Simply let us know when[n]you're ready, [f 4 2].[n][w][e]
