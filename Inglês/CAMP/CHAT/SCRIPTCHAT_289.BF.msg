[s][f 5 14]I've been trying to wrap my head[n]around all this, and...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]It's just not happening. I can't[n]think straight at all.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]I can hardly blame you. I'm[n]still so confused, myself...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Either way, I think we've all[n]earned a bit of rest.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Maybe a good night's sleep will[n]help us all calm down.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]You're right.[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]Certainly, the combat has us tired[n]out as well. We could all use some[n]time to decompress.[n][w][e]

[s][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]Either way, we can think about this[n]tomorrow. For now... we should go[n]to sleep.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
