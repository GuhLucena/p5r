[s][f 5 14]I went to see Shiho today.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]And I told her we settled[n]things with Kamoshida.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]She still hasn't regained[n]consciousness... but I had[n]to go make amends.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Whaddya mean? You didn't[n]do anything wrong, Ann.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Right, [f 4 2]?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_005_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]It's not your fault, Ann.[e]
[s]This is Kamoshida's doing.[e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]But I wasn't there when she[n]needed help. I'm a failure[n]as a friend...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I have to do all I can to make[n]up for that, starting now.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Otherwise I don't think[n]I'll be able to move on.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Man, I didn't know you[n]were so passionate.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I totally didn't notice that[n]back in middle school.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I think it's because of you guys.[n]I'm a little embarrassed though...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Anyway, Ryuji, [f 4 2]...[n]I hope we can keep helping[n]each other out from now on too.[n][w][e]
