[s][f 5 14]Would you really forgive[n]someone unconditionally if[n]you owe your life to them?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I'm not so sure anymore.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]What're you bringing this up for?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]According to Kitagawa-kun,[n]Madarame isn't a problem.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_004_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]What do you mean?[e]
[s]Is something wrong?[e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Something wrong?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, a little.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I mean, I know Madarame is a[n]bad person, but still...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Maybe I'm so hesitant because[n]I haven't actually met any of[n]his victims.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, I guess that part's[n]totally different from what[n]happened with Kamoshida.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]This might be an extreme[n]line of thinking...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]But if an evil person isn't[n]causing any trouble now...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Is there really a point[n]in us stepping in?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Well... you got a point.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]So we're gonna let Yusuke[n]decide if Madarame's worth[n]going after or not?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I dunno... If it were me, I'd[n]never forgive that bastard![n][w][e]

[sel SEL_014_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Let's see how Yusuke feels.[e]
[s]Can you ask Yusuke, Ann?[e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah... I guess we could[n]talk some more after that.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Kk, got it.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I guess we can talk some more[n]about this after that.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]OK. Let's meet in Shibuya[n]after school tomorrow.[n][w][e]
