[s][f 5 14]The election battle has[n]reached the halfway point.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]The polls for each election ward[n]have remained the same though.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Does this mean Shido's[n]victory is guaranteed?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]That would be the case.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]I wonder if voting will shift[n]if Shido has a change of heart...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Nobody'll vote for him once[n]they find out he's a criminal.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Assuming they find out[n]before they vote.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]That's the important part.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]We would prefer him to announce[n]his crimes before the election...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]But if the change of heart[n]doesn't make it, the election[n]will go just as expected.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_010_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]We have to believe.[e]
[s]Results aren't what matters.[e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, I'm sure it'll[n]happen beforehand![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]You are correct.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]So long as his true nature is[n]brought to light, other options[n]will be available to us.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]All we can do is[n]change his heart.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]We should be able to put a[n]stop to this if we succeed...[n][w][e]
