[s][f 5 14]You guys hear about this cleanup[n]bullshit at Inokashira Park?[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]I guess it's the principal's idea.[n]Damage control after Kamoshida[n]scandaled up the school's rep.[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]Pretty sure "scandal"'s not a verb.[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]All the girls in our class have been[n]freaking out over this new guy,[n]too.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I've been hearing Maruki's "hot,"[n]"mature," "approachable," "got a[n]voice like velvet chocolate"...[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]Guess he's popular.[e]

[s][f 5 14]Well, he's apparently open for[n]counseling sessions after school[n]in the nurse's office.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Maybe it's worth trying. We did[n]kinda promise we would.[n][w][e]
