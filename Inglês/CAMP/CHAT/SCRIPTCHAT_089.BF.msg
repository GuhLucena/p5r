[s][f 5 14]Damn, motorcycles are cool...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I wish my Persona was like that.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Yours is on a ship though.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Dude, you kidding!? Motorcycles[n]are way cooler than dumb boats![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]It'll be just like the[n]song! "I'm a phantom, on[n]a steel horse I ride..."[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Don't say such things. And[n]for the record, I am most[n]certainly not "wanted."[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Honestly, I'm mostly just[n]surprised you know how to ride a[n]motorcycle at all, Niijima-senpai.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Do you got a license?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]A regular one, yes.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Niceee... I can't wait to[n]get my hands on one too.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]That aside, mind if I change[n]the topic for a moment?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]What is the matter?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]I'm sorry, everyone.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]I know I'm not in any position[n]to be saying that. I truly do...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]However, I must apologize.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]It was my actions that dragged[n]all of you into this mess.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]On top of that, I misunderstood[n]your true intentions in this.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_023_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]If only I could have realized what[n]was happening to Suzui-san too...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_024_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Come on, we don't need[n]to talk about that now.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_025_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]It seems there are still lingering[n]issues on everyone's minds.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_026_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Now's not the time to be[n]talking about that shit though![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_027_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Don't we gotta be doing[n]something about Kaneshiro?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_028_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]He's right.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_029_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Very well, I understand.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_030_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Anyway, I will do my best to make[n]sure I don't slow you all down.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 3 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 10 0 0]Well, we were at odds with each other[n]until just a while ago...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 2 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 11 0 0]But Ryuji's totally right. We need to work[n]together to overcome this![n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
