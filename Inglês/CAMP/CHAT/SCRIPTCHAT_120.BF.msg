[s][f 5 14]Hm, Father has begun acting[n]a little odd lately.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]He has been cooped up in his[n]study, and his voice lacks energy.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]That actually sounds quite similar[n]to what Madarame went through.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]And Madarame still had a[n]change of heart in the end.[n]Don't worry, Haru.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Is that so...?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Oh, my apologies! I don't mean[n]to doubt you or anything![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Makoto]]

[s][f 5 14]People just act a bit weird after[n]their Treasure gets stolen.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]It'd be hard not to worry about[n]such a sudden shift.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_009_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]It'll be OK, Haru.[e]
[s]Don't let your guard down.[e]
[s]Futaba knows all about that.[e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Right.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Come on, don't scare her.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah. I really gotta thank you[n]again for helping me back then.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Haru]]
