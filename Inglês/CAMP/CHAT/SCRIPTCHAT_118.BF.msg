[s][f 5 14]Unless he confesses, there's no[n]way this is gonna change.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ryuji]]

[s][f 5 14]In that case, it wasn't a mistake[n]for us to change his heart.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I mean, we made the best[n]possible choice, didn't we?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Assuming the change of[n]heart is successful.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]It sucks real bad that we can't[n]do anything more than that...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]It would be nice to have one...[n]but we don't have the time.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ann]]
