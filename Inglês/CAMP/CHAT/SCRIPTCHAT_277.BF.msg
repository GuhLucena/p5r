[s][f 5 14]No.[e]
[s][f 5 14]What news?[e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Did something happen?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]You talkin' about the robbery?[n]I'm surprised you already[n]know, Ryuji.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Robbery?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Yesterday, someone broke into[n]an apartment in Yongen.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Seems like the only victim was[n]this part-timer who lives by[n]himself.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]But guess what! The part-[n]timer was...[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_007_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Toji Karataki?[e]
[s][f 5 14]Who?[e]

[msg MSG_008_1_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Toji Karataki.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Seriously!?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Seriously. I checked on my[n]end too.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Someone robbed his home while[n]he was in custody? And on a false[n]charge, no less...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]How awful...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]But there's somethin' weird[n]goin' on.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]The robber didn't actually take[n]anything of value.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Nothing? Did he give up partway?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]No idea.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]If I may interject...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I myself have some details to[n]share on this case.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]About time. I was getting sick[n]of waiting.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_017_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Let's hear it.[e]
[s][f 5 14]Got dirt on the Diet member?[e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]The Diet member who brought[n]charges on Toji Karataki...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]His name is Hisashi Morozumi.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Most of my information on him[n]can be grouped into two parts.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]First, regarding Morozumi's past.[n]Before becoming a member of the[n]Diet, he worked as a secretary.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Around then, he married the[n]daughter of the former cabinet[n]minister—a secretary herself.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]That's about when he made his[n]grand debut in the political world.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Man. He already sounds kinda[n]sleazy.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]You're just jealous.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]However, Morozumi was soon[n]embroiled in a certain scandal.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_023_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]What incident?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_024_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]He was having an affair.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Once the mess with his mistress[n]came to light, he was almost forced[n]to resign from office.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_025_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Wow. So he's trash.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_026_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]I daresay it served him right.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_027_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]But that incident was abruptly[n]cut short.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Because the mistress ended up[n]committing suicide.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_028_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]What!?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_029_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]She killed herself...?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_030_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]And that's all I found on[n]Morozumi's past.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Now, we move on to his recent[n]behavior—just prior to this latest[n]incident.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]He'd reportedly been acting very[n]strange. As if he's been stressed[n]about something.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Moreover, on the day of the[n]incident, he went all the way to[n]see Karataki at his part-time job.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]And he wasn't going as[n]a customer.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_031_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Wait... You mean to say there's[n]some connection between[n]Morozumi and Toji-kun?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_032_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]At the very least, Morozumi[n]seems to know him.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_033_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]That's all I've got so far.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]But one aspect of this seems rather[n]suspicious. Perhaps you've already[n]noticed it yourself?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_034_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]The suicide.[e]
[s][f 5 14]The mistress and Toji's mother...[e]
[s][f 5 14]No. No idea.[e]

[msg MSG_035_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Right. Toji Karataki said his mother[n]committed suicide, too.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]On the surface, both parties had a[n]female figure in their lives commit[n]suicide.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]My question is: what if these two[n]women were the same person?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_035_1_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Yes. Both dead by their own hand.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]On the surface, both parties had a[n]female figure in their lives commit[n]suicide.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]My question is: what if these two[n]women were the same person?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_035_2_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]Toji-san's mother committed[n]suicide too, didn't she...?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_036_2_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]That's right.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]On the surface, both parties had a[n]female figure in their lives commit[n]suicide.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]My question is: what if these two[n]women were the same person?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_037_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]That would make Morozumi and[n]Toji father and son...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_038_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Does that mean Toji-kun was[n]falsely accused by his own father?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_039_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]It's certainly not impossible. Do[n]you know Toji Karataki's original[n]surname?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_040_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]I believe it was Ushiwata.[e]
[s][f 5 14]It wasn't Morozumi.[e]

[msg MSG_041_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Oh... I thought they were[n]actually related. [n][w][e]

[msg MSG_042_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Actually, there's one other thing[n]that's been bothering me.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]When I put Morozumi's name in[n]the Nav, nothing comes up.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_043_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Huh? Does he not have a[n]Shadow?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_044_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Like hell! A normal guy wouldn't[n]frame his own son![n][w][e]

[sel SEL_045_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]There must be another reason.[e]
[s][f 5 14]Are the keywords wrong?[e]
[s][f 5 14]I have absolutely no idea.[e]

[msg MSG_046_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]That's possible.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_046_1_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Aha. That's certainly possible.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_046_2_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Same. I give up.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_047_2_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Does he really not have[n]a Shadow...?[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]There has to be some other[n]reason for this.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_048_2_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Aha. That's certainly possible.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_049_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]I think I have a grasp of things now.[n]I'm going to do a little more[n]investigating on my end.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_050_0_0 [Yusuke]]

[s][f 5 14]I am a detective, aren't I?[n][w][e]
