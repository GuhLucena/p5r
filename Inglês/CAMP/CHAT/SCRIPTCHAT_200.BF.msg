[s][f 5 14]Arihara made a post on[n]the Phan-Site.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]He told all the girls the truth. And[n]he's giving back all the money he[n]took from them, too.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I don't know how he'll atone for[n]the ones he hurt, or the ones he[n]drove out of school...[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_001_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Sounds complicated.[e]
[s]No more victims, though.[e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It's not exactly the cleanest[n]resolution, I guess.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah! That's something to be[n]happy about.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I guess this mission got me thinking[n]about the Kamoshida stuff again.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Kamoshida was so popular. Even[n]though he was abusing his power[n]to get whatever he wanted.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]At the time... I felt like I didn't have[n]a choice but to go along with it.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]So when it looked like Arihara was[n]manipulating those girls in the[n]same way...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I dunno. I guess a little bit of[n]the rage came back.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Kind of embarrassing, in[n]hindsight...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Sorry about that.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_005_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Don't worry about it.[e]
[s]That's just like you.[e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]...Yeah, I guess it is![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Thanks, [f 4 2].[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 1 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1180 65535 0]I'm glad to see Lady Ann's happy. Her[n]smile makes everything worthwhile...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[sel SEL_009_0_0 top]
[s]You can see her smiling?[e]
[s]It's just text.[e]
