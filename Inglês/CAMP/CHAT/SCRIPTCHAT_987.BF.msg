[s][f 5 14]The heck is that!? It's intense![n]Not my style, though.[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]Hey, we didn't buy it. It was[n]kinda expensive anyway.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]I only wish I could've bought it[n]for sketching purposes...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]It was probably a good call[n]not to buy it.[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]If nothing else, it would've been[n]a problem at the airport. Customs[n]would've been a nightmare.[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]God, I could see that. Worst-case[n]scenario, Yusuke would've just[n]had to stay in Hawaii forever.[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]It'd be a lovely place to spend my[n]retirement. Living surrounded by[n]natural beauty, and all that food...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]You're already thinking about[n]retirement? That's decades off...[n][w][e]
