[s][f 5 14]Hey! You did it! You got that[n]complaining housewife![n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Not only did she stop making[n]complaints, but she's going around[n]apologizing as well.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]She's saying it was wrong of her to[n]think she was so important just[n]'cause she paid for stuff.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]From now on, she's going to try[n]to remember to be thankful[n]when she's out shopping.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]...But if the store actually does[n]something wrong, you're[n]supposed to complain, right?[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Even that seems like too much for[n]me. Do you feel like it's hard to[n]complain, even if it's justified?[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]It's easy.[e]
[s]I'm no good at it.[e]
[s]It's case by case.[e]

[s][f 5 14]Wow, you've got guts.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_035_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]I know exactly what you mean.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_036_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Like it depends on who you're[n]dealing with? I get that.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_037_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Anyways, that's another[n]case closed![n][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]Maybe I should file a complaint with the[n]owner of Mementos for wasting our time.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MND_quest05_CLEAR_SELF]
[s][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]It seems we successfully[n]changed the target's heart.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
