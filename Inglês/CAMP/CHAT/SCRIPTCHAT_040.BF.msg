[s][f 5 14]That Akechi bastard... Thinking[n]about what he said is just[n]pissing me off again.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]He clearly tried to discredit[n]everything we're doing.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]And he just had to say[n]it on live TV too![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Don't be so sour.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]There are, without a doubt,[n]people we have saved.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Those people could not have been[n]saved if not for the heroics[n]of the Phantom Thieves.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]I am living proof of that.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Awww, what a nice thing to say![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Still... was what Akechi-kun[n]said actually wrong?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I feel like he had a point.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Why you gotta bring that up now?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I mean, is it really OK to[n]be doing this to people just[n]because they're criminals?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Doesn't it seem a little selfish?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]We are phantom thieves, Ann.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]I doubt everyone would forgive[n]us for what we did to Madarame.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Yet, I still decided that[n]it was a necessary act.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Kamoshida too. We weren't[n]gonna do shit to him through[n]any kinda normal methods.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]That's true, but...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]What do you think, [f 4 2]?[n]Are we being selfish?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_020_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]I can't deny that.[e]
[s]We're helping people.[e]
[s]Akechi makes me so mad.[e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]This is tough...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I guess I can't really[n]think of any other way...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_023_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I totally agree with that![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_024_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Guys, I'm being serious here![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_025_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Hm. I believe our best path[n]forward is sticking to our[n]justice, not that of the law.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_026_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Shouldn't that be enough?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_027_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]And with the unanimous[n]decision rule in place,[n]I doubt we'll lose our way.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_028_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]...Yeah, you're right.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_029_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Sorry for bringing that up.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_030_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]And don't worry, I'm not[n]thinking about quitting the[n]Phantom Thieves or anything.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_031_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Just you watch, Akechi.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_032_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Someday you're totally gonna[n]see who was right![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_033_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]OK, let's stop talking[n]about this for now.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 2 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 1 0 0]That detective Akechi seems to have a lot[n]of influence on the media.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 2 0 0]It'd be dangerous to get too close to him,[n]but he may actually prove useful in some[n]situations.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
