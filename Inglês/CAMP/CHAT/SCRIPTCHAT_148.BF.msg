[s][f 5 14]Every news station has been[n]running story after story about[n]Shido and the elections...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Akechi too. I can't believe[n]they're calling him the[n]detective of the century![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Plus they're treating the[n]Phantom Thieves like criminals.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]That side of things has[n]faded a little bit though,[n]don't you think?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Yes, all the talk of the[n]elections must have made people[n]forget about the suicide news.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]The main culprit is "dead,"[n]things are settled, and[n]society can go on like normal.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]That's probably what[n]people are thinking...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Hm. I have mixed feelings[n]about all of this.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I'm not saying they should talk[n]about us more, but the sudden[n]change in momentum is weird...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]All we gotta do is hurry up[n]and steal Shido's heart.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]That'll take care of[n]everything, right?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_011_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]You're right.[e]
[s]Don't get hasty.[e]
[s]You think?[e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Everything up until the[n]elections is the real battle![n]Let's take him down![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Yes, there is no knowing what may[n]happen. Be sure to prepare well.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]It's good to hear you're treating[n]this situation with caution. We[n]need to be careful.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Well then, we can discuss this[n]more tomorrow! Let's do our best![n][w][e]
