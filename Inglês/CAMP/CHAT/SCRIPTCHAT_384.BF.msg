[s][f 5 14]That creep hasn't tried[n]anything funny, right Haru?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]No, I'm OK. Thank you[n]for asking, Ann-chan.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Father did say he'd rescind[n]the marriage offer as well.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]I'm a bit worried though...[n]There's still some time[n]before the deadline.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]If anything happens,[n]be sure to let us know.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Thanks, Mako-chan. I will[n]gladly rely on all of you.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]There is also the matter of[n]the mental shutdowns. I hope[n]no danger comes to Haru...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]I guess Haru's dad did say that[n]he was just making requests.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Yes. The true culprit is still[n]out there, triggering mental[n]shutdowns in exchange for money.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]We gotta catch whoever it is...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Any idea who that culprit[n]might be, [f 4 2]?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_011_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]The black-masked person.[e]
[s]A money monger.[e]
[s]I have no idea.[e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Yes, they're definitely the[n]most likely perpetrator.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Performing mental shutdowns to[n]enrich one's wallet is truly[n]a vulgar act...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Either way, I'm sure we'll[n]learn more once Haru's[n]father speaks up about it.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]We just gotta wait for[n]his change of heart![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_MORUEND_00 [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 2 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 1 0 0]Futaba's right. We don't have any intel[n]now, so there's nothing we can do.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 2 0 0]Let's wait for Okumura's change of heart,[n]then pursue the truth behind the mental[n]shutdowns![n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
