[s][f 5 14]Man, this is crazy.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I can't keep up with this[n]constant influx of posts.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Isn't it tough being[n]popular, [f 4 28]?[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Anyway, here's the[n]latest lead I have.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]This one seems to be about...[n]someone abusing their power?[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I wonder if it was written[n]by a former employee of the[n]company in question.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Apparently one of the higher-ups[n]has been claiming the achievements[n]of his subordinates as his own.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]That really sucks.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_008_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]That's some business sense.[e]
[s]He's not worth our time.[e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_quest09_01 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]You can't seriously just[n]be accepting of that![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_quest09_02 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]What, not feeling it? You might[n]want to look into it anyway.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_quest09_03 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Now, I know the name of the[n]company, but I don't have any[n]details on the person himself.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]The company's over in Shinjuku,[n]so try asking around places where[n]business men could hang out.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]A bar at night might be a start.[n]That should be a good place to[n]get more info on this situation.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]I hope this isn't asking too much[n]of you... Sorry, I'll look for[n]another one, just in case.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 2 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1037 65535 0]It'd be a shame to let this one slip away.[n]This is a textbook example of corporate[n]exploitation.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 3 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 65535 0]It might be difficult to get the employees[n]to open up to you though...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 65535 0]Maybe if you [clr 2]get a job at a bar[clr 27], you'll[n]be able to learn some information.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MND_quest09_OPEN_SELF]
[s]I've obtained intel on a target.[n]Perhaps I should see what everyone[n]has to say at the hideout...[n][w][e]
