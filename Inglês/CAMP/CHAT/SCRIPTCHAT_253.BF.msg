[s][f 5 14]I have some new info![n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Apparently there's a group of[n]burglars terrorizing Shibuya.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]From what I hear, they only[n]target restaurants and break in[n]after they close for the day.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Someone online was asking[n]if it was the work of the[n]Phantom Thieves...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Just reading that got[n]me really pissed off![n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]We can't let people lump you guys[n]in with petty thieves, right!?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_005_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]No way.[e]
[s]But aren't we the same?[e]
[s]Just forget about it.[e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah! You guys are way[n]better than these jerks![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]What!? You can't[n]seriously believe that![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Hearing that just makes[n]it bother me even more.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Anyway, I heard they've been[n]running away without leaving[n]even a trace of evidence.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]That's all the information I[n]have on them right now... Sorry.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]For now, I'll make a post on the[n]Phan-Site and ask for any more[n]details people might know.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 2 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 65535 1038 0 0]Man, being famous really brings its own[n]unique set of problems...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]But we don't really have any info. We'll[n]just have to wait for Mishima to get a[n]more solid lead.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
