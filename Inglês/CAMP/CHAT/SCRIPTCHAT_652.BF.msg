[s][f 5 14]It took a while,[n]but I got some info.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]First, I heard something from[n]Mr. Manda, my math teacher.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Apparently he knows what[n]Ms. Kawakami's doing![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Kinda makes you respect[n]Ms. Kawakami a bit, doesn't it?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Next up! I heard this from[n]a second-year girl.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]She was pretty cute.[n]She likes European sweets.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]So apparently Ms. Kawakami[n]used to work part-time at[n]a bakery called Becky.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Can you believe she did a part-time[n]job? She's such a hard worker![n]And finally, number three![n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]By the entrance to the school,[n]a first-year girl was handing out[n]flyers for the drama club![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]It looks like they're going to do a[n]play about maids. The girl handing[n]out the flyers was super cute.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Well... That's it.[n][w][e]
