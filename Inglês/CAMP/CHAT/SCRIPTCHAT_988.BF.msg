[s][f 5 14]Man. Even yakisoba looks high-[n]class when Haru's eating it.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Please, you're exaggerating...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]I think this is my first time having[n]yakisoba from a food stand,[n]though.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]It was more delicious than[n]I'd imagined![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]It was! It wasn't the instant[n]stuff, but still good.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah. Dunno why, but food from a[n]stall is always weirdly tasty.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Speakin' of, where are the[n]pictures of us, Ann?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Hm?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]You got pics of us too, right?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]How about the one you took of[n][f 4 2]'s yakisoba? With the[n]big red mountain of ginger?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Ohhh![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]No, THAT one went straight into[n]the trash. I had dry seaweed all[n]over my teeth![n][w][e]
