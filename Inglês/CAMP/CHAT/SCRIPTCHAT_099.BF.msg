[s][f 5 14]Makoto, you OK? Has Kaneshiro[n]threatened you or anything?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]He's been demanding money, but I[n]choose to ignore those messages.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Is that OK? Have any scary men[n]shown up at your house?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]No.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Kaneshiro still has the photographs[n]in his possession, remember?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Perhaps that advantage is why he[n]doesn't feel any urgency to act.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]So do you think we're[n]safe for now then?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_007_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Yup.[e]
[s]I'm kinda worried.[e]
[s]All we can do is hope...[e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]You're wrong.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]As you should be.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, I know how you feel.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Just like Yusuke said, those[n]pictures are bad news for us.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]We will need to change Kaneshiro's[n]heart as soon as possible.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Agreed. I will do[n]everything I can to help.[n][w][e]
