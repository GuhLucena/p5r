[s][f 5 14]Sorry to bother you while you[n]are expecting information from[n]that journalist.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]However, do you remember that[n]thread about the group of[n]burglars in Shibuya?[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It seems the one who posted[n]about his brother is a[n]student at my school.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]And so after some prodding, I[n]was able to pry a few more[n]details out of him.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_057_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Oh, right! I was actually[n]wondering about that.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It didn't sound like they had[n]anything to do with the mafia[n]we've been chasing.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_064_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Indeed. Now, I was able to[n]ascertain his brother's name...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It's Kazuya Makigami.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_058_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Dude, it's freaking crazy that[n]someone involved in that shit[n]goes to your school.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Nice going, Yusuke![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_060_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]And you even found the name[n]of the guy we're looking for![n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]That was super awesome![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_063_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]All we gotta do now is[n]punish him in Mementos.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]This burglar guy isn't gonna[n]be near as scary as the mafia.[n]He's just a plain dude, right?[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]We'll show him what being a[n]phantom thief's really about![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_065_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]It seems we are unanimous then.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]We can further discuss the[n]details at the hideout.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_quest11_MORGANA_SAY [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1020 65535 0]We have our target! We also have the[n]mafia to deal with too, so make sure[n]the timing's right.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]Anyway, let's all meet up at the hideout[n]when you're ready.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MND_quest11_OPEN_SELF]
[s]I've obtained intel on a target.[n]Perhaps I should see what everyone[n]has to say at the hideout...[n][w][e]
