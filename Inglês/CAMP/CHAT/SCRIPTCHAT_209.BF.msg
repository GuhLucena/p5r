[s][f 5 14]Hey, sorry for bringing this up[n]when things are so chaotic...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I know it's been tough after[n]what happened to President[n]Okumura and all...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]But this is the perfect time[n]for smaller changes of heart to[n]restore your reputation.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Anyway, here's the info I have...[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]Hey, sorry to bring this up now.[n]I know you have your hands full...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]But [f 4 28] can do it.[n]I have faith in all of you.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Anyway, here's the info I have...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_quest34_00 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]This isn't actually a[n]request from the Phan-Site,[n]but a personal one...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]The truth is, a younger student[n]came to consult with me about[n]something the other day.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It sounds like he's getting[n]blackmailed at his job...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]By the store manager.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_042_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]This is inexcusable.[e]
[s]The manager?[e]

[msg MSG_043_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Right!?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_044_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_quest34_02 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]From what he told me, money went[n]missing from the register he was[n]supposed to be in charge of.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]As such, he's been falsely[n]accused of stealing money[n]from the store.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]And now the manager's making[n]him pay back the full amount.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It's 50,000 yen...[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_045_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]That's a lot of money.[e]
[s]This seems odd.[e]
[s]50,000 yen...[e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_quest34_03 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, this guy is like the[n]most honest person I know.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]There's no way he'd steal[n]all that money.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]And well, I did some research[n]into the store online...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]According to some rumors,[n]the manager might be the one[n]stealing the money...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]He's the only person who checks[n]the registers, after all...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]On top of that, some other staff[n]members saw him taking cash out[n]when he was calculating totals.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Anyway, the guy's name seems to[n]be Nozomi Odo. I found it out[n]when I looked into the store.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Please, you gotta[n]help this student![n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 2 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1020 65535 0]So the manager's taking the money for[n]himself AND blackmailing the kid to[n]pay for it?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]Now that's nasty. Let's talk it over at[n]the hideout when we have the chance,[n]okay?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
