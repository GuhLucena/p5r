[s][f 5 14]Would someone normally call[n]themselves Beauty Thief...?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I bet Morgana made her say it...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Uh, it's still a weird thing[n]to say, even if he told her to.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Plus they lied about her being[n]able to use a Persona too...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]We don't know if that[n]is indeed a lie though.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]But we didn't see her use one.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]No matter how you slice it,[n]she's totally just an amateur.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_007_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Don't let your guard down.[e]
[s]She was bluffing for sure.[e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I don't think we gotta[n]worry about that, dude.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, that's gotta be it. Though[n]that actually worries me more...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]We can't take her lightly. She has[n]Morgana on her side, remember?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]I agree with Futaba.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]At the very least, they're[n]one step ahead of us.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]True. An amateur would not have[n]been able to open that gate.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]They've clearly figured out[n]something we don't know.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]We'll need to uncover the[n]identity of that masked girl...[n][w][e]
