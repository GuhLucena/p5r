[s][f 5 14]Have you guys figured out the[n]keyword to Shido's Palace yet?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]I've tried all sortsa stuff,[n]but no luck so far.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]It is hard to understand the[n]thought process of a criminal[n]mastermind like him.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Y'know, I've been wondering...[n]If he's been behind all of[n]those mental shutdowns...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Doesn't that mean all the weird[n]accidents from these past few[n]years were his fault?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Like, that subway[n]accident back in April...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Now that you mention it, that[n]accident lost the Minister of[n]Transport his job...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Wait... Are you trying to say[n]Shido caused that accident?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]But it's the subway! Does he not[n]care at all about innocent lives!?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]This man seems to be[n]truly unbelievable...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Futaba]]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Masayoshi Shido... How many[n]has he killed over the years?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]How could we ever understand[n]what goes on in the mind of[n]such a horrible man...?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Hey, wouldn't it be faster if[n]we just go there and try and[n]think about it on-site!?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Let's try that![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]If we're going to go, I'd like[n][f 4 2]-kun to join, but...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Will that be OK? Won't[n]somebody spot him there?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Eh, we'll prolly figure[n]out the keyword in no[n]time once we're there.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Plus I can throw off anyone who[n]tails us with my blazing speed![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]...All right. Let's have[n][f 4 2]-kun join us then.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Remember though... We're going[n]with the intent of not being seen.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Mkay. Well, let's meet in front[n]of the Diet Building and force[n]that bastard's Palace open![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_MORUEND_00 [Morgana]]
