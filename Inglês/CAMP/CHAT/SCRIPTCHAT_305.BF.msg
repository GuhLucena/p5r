[s][f 5 14]We gotta talk about Medjed.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]You mean those guys people[n]online are going nuts over?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Medjed...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]That name seems to come from[n]one of the obscure gods from[n]the Egyptian Book of the Dead.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]I saw the news too.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]For some reason they think[n]we speak of false justice...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Now then, what exactly did you[n]want to speak of regarding Medjed?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Wellllll, why don't we go after[n]them as our next target?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]What a sudden suggestion.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I mean they're like, bad[n]hackers or something, right?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Technically, they're crackers.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Those who use the internet to[n]illegally access and alter data.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Medjed is an organized group of[n]such people recognized by the[n]larger international community.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]So they operate on a global scale?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]That makes them even[n]bigger than Kaneshiro![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Right!?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Then it's settled. Our next[n]target's gonna be Medjed.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I wonder if the Nav'll get a[n]hit if we put Medjed in.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Oh, right![n][w][e]

[sel SEL_019_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Let's try it out.[e]
[s]That's impossible.[e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]That would be impossible. It has[n]to be a pseudonym. We don't even[n]know how many people Medjed is.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Yes. That name has to be a[n]pseudonym. We don't even know[n]how many people Medjed is.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Oh...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_023_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Wouldn't we get at least one[n]member's info if we try and[n]look into it though?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_024_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Even if we did, how would we[n]discover their location?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_025_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]The only confirmed presence[n]of Medjed has been online.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_026_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]This is a greater problem than[n]simply finding their keywords.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_027_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Unless you have any[n]more ideas, Ryuji?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_028_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Hellooo?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_029_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]...It seems he had suggested[n]this without putting much[n]thought into it.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_030_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]C'mon, we can't back down now![n]People are all excited about it![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_031_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Our reputation's gonna plummet[n]if we don't face this shit.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_032_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]That is true. If we remain silent,[n]people would believe we simply[n]chose to run away from the matter.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_033_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Medjed has taunted us[n]publicly, after all...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_034_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]If they are criminals, we[n]cannot just let them be.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_035_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_036_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]And we don't have any other[n]targets right now either.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_037_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Hey, [f 4 2]. Let's talk to[n]Mishima tomorrow. This is[n]more of his thing.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_038_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Let's do that.[e]
[s]Is Mishima part of Medjed?[e]
[s]Do what you want.[e]

[msg MSG_039_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I doubt that.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_040_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I don't mind asking him, but[n]you better come along![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_041_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Also, Makoto. Try seeing if[n]your sister has any info on 'em.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_042_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]It's highly unlikely, but sure.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_MORUEND_00 [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 4 0 0]A world-class target, huh?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 5 0 0]If we can change Medjed's heart, it'll[n]most definitely affect Mementos.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
