[s][f 5 14]Do you think the culprit[n]could be someone at school?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]That seems somewhat sudden.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]I mean, didn't they find a[n]calling card in Principal[n]Kobayakawa's office?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]I thought you had suggested[n]that idea yourself, Yusuke.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]That was just a generalization.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]But if Mako-chan noticed what was[n]going on with you guys, somebody[n]else might have too.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]So you think that "somebody else"[n]is trying to frame us? What's[n]gotten into you so suddenly?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Nothing has gotten into me.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]I just think there's a chance the[n]culprit is related to Shujin...[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_009_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]You might be right.[e]
[s]There's no way.[e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]What is all of this about?[n]It's too soon to be jumping[n]to conclusions like this.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Well, I was hoping to hear[n]a professional opinion on[n]the matter...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]What are your thoughts,[n]Akechi-kun?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]The possibility is not zero, but[n]it does seem a bit unlikely.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Why do you ask?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]A normal person would[n]never do such a thing.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]They would have no reason to[n]callously murder your principal.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]And what if they weren't normal?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Are you implying they kill[n]for the sheer pleasure of it?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]No, not like that.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]What I mean is, you need certain[n]special abilities to navigate[n]through that world, yes?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Ah, so you're saying the[n]culprit is a Persona-user.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Yes.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_023_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]I see... How perceptive.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_024_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Truthfully, I was considering[n]that possibility myself.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_025_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]But it is still difficult to think[n]they have ties to Shujin Academy.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_026_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Why?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_027_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]There would be no motive for them[n]to carry out such a cruel plot.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_028_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Clearly our culprit is acting[n]behind the scenes to accomplish[n]some grand objective.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_029_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]He likely has accomplices.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_030_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]It is even possible that he is[n]being controlled by someone.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_031_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Controlled? By whom?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_032_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]If we knew that, I do not think[n]we would be in this much trouble.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_033_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]I see... So even someone like[n]you doesn't know, Akechi-kun.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_034_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Looks like our genius detective's[n]not so much of a genius after all.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_035_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Haha, harsh as always.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_036_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]If there is one thing I know, it[n]is that the culprit behind all of[n]this is extremely shrewd.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_037_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]But don't worry. I will catch[n]him, no matter what it takes.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_038_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]I'm looking forward to that.[e]
[s]I wonder if you can do it.[e]

[msg MSG_039_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]More importantly, we need to[n]focus on changing Sae-san's[n]heart for the time being.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_040_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]If we cannot do that, everything[n]we have done will be for naught.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_041_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]We absolutely must succeed here.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_MORUEND_00 [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 2 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 1 0 0]He's right. If we get caught now, all our[n]hard work will amount to nothing.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 2 0 0]We really have to pull this off.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
