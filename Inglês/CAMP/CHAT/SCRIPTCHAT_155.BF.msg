[s][f 5 14]So about Haru's dad... Uh...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]The news said it was[n]a cardiac arrest...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]There's a chance he'll[n]pull through, right...?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]I hate to say this...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]But usually after such a report,[n]the only thing that follows is[n]a confirmation of death...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]No...![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Haru...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Why is this happening!?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Can someone die simply from[n]having a mental shutdown!?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]I don't know![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]I suppose it's possible that the[n]shock could kill a person...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Haru did mention how her father[n]wasn't in the best of health...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]But... for him to just up and die?[n]This has gotta be some kinda joke...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]...Are we responsible[n]for his death?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]But I thought it was supposed[n]to be fine as long as we didn't[n]kill their Shadow![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Ain't that what you said, Morgana!?[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 2 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 33 0 0]It should've been okay![n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 5 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 34 0 0]It... should've been...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[sel SEL_018_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]He says it should've been OK.[e]
[s]Why did this happen...?[e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, there's no point getting[n]mad at Mona for this! I heard[n]the same thing too, you know...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]We did everything the[n]same as always too...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]In any case, let's compose[n]ourselves for now. We need[n]to act normally in public.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]But keep Haru in our minds...[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 36 0 0]But what are we supposed to do from[n]here on out...?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
