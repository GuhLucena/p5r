[s][f 5 14]This request kinda caught my[n]eye on the Phan-Site.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]"An indie idol tricked my dad, and[n]now my family's falling apart."[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]"It's that idol's fault that my mom[n]and dad fight all the time."[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]"Mom got really mad today. She[n]was shouting about them 'heading[n]for divorce'..."[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]"I just want mom and dad to be[n]happy again." So... you get the[n]picture.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I think this poster's just a kid.[n]Makes all this shit hit a little[n]harder, you know?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_001_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Poor kid.[e]
[s]This is over some idol?[e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah. Sucks to come home to[n]an arguin' family...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Anyhow, I did some digging on[n]this indie idol lady.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, I was wondering about that[n]too. So I did some digging.[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]Her stage name's Star Lilina.[n]Honestly, though, she seems[n]pretty on the level.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]No shady business, no cheatin'[n]the fans, nothin'.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]No hits on the Nav, either.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]If I had to guess, I'd say it's[n]the dad who's the problem[n]on this one.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Sounds like he goes to Akihabara[n]every day. Wanna go check it out?[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1021 65535 0]So this dad's obsessed with an indie[n]idol, huh?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 3 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 65535 0]Well, we'll need his name before we[n]can do anything else.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1099 65535 0]I guess we should go to Akihabara and[n]try gathering some information.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
