[s][f 5 14]So, do you think Lavenza will[n]make it to the school?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I hope she doesn't get lost[n]or anything...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, don'tcha think it's a bad[n]idea, her wanderin' around in[n]that getup?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]That's true... Hopefully no one[n]gives her a hard time.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]If someone does, you better[n]come up with a good excuse[n]for her, [f 4 2]![n][w][e]

[sel SEL_006_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]I'll handle it.[e]
[s]Morgana's on top of it.[e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]What'll you even say? Your[n]options're kinda limited as[n]a transfer student.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Just say she's your little sister[n]or somethin'.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]A kitty helping out a little kid...[n]Sounds like one dynamite duo![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]That could last three seasons[n]and a movie, easy![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]That's not exactly helpful to us[n]right now, though...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]At any rate, I'm certain she would[n]reach out to us if something were[n]to go awry.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]That's true—we can put our faith[n]in Lavenza.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Agreed. Let us know if anything[n]changes, [f 4 2].[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Good night, everyone.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1175 65535 0]Why would Lady Lavenza want to meet up[n]at the school? It's not like she just wants to[n]check out the place... right?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
