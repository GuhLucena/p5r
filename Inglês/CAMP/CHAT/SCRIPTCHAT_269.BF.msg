[s][f 5 14]Do you have a moment? I'd like to[n]share something interesting.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_001_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]I'm listening.[e]
[s]How interesting?[e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]There's a certain man in police[n]custody, awaiting trial...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]His accuser is a member of the[n]Diet. According to his claims, the[n]man assaulted him.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]But I suspect they're false charges.[n]Something about the accusation[n]doesn't ring true.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 2 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1170 65535 0]A false charge by a Diet member?[n]Wait, that's just like...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Perhaps you can sympathize.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]After all, it's not too far removed[n]from your own unfortunate story.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]With one crucial difference:[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Why hasn't the accused spoken[n]up in his own defense?[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]At this rate, a guilty verdict[n]seems inevitable.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]There has to be some hidden[n]reason behind all this.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_07_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]So why tell me?[e]
[s][f 5 14]We can't ignore this.[e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Well, considering what you and[n]your group do, I imagine you could[n]hardly abandon him to his fate...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I simply found the information,[n]and thought you might like to do[n]something about it.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_1_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]I'd expect no less. Indeed, you can[n]be rather predictable sometimes.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 5 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Still as high-and-mighty as ever...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]But he's right. We can't just turn a blind[n]eye to this.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1181 65535 0]Well, I don't care if Akechi's kind of[n]manipulating us into this. We should[n]help this guy out.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]The man worked part-time at the[n]Beef Bowl shop on Central Street.[n]The "assault" occurred there too.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I think that might be a good[n]place to start investigating.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_011_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]What about you, Akechi?[e]
[s][f 5 14]You're helping too.[e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Oh, I'll be helping in my own way.[n]Something about it's been on my[n]mind.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I'll be looking into this alleged[n]victim, the Diet member. If I find[n]anything, you'll be first to know.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_1_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Naturally. I've had a plan in[n]mind myself.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I'll look into this alleged victimâ€”[n]the Diet member. If I find anything[n]actionable, I'll let you know.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_013_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Got it.[e]
[s][f 5 14]No slacking off.[e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]I'll be counting on you to[n]find some usable info.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_1_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Oh, I know. Remember, I am[n]a detective myself.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]Okay. First order of business is gathering[n]information. Once we loop the team in,[n]we can start investigating.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
