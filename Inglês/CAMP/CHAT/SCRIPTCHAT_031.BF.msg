[s][f 5 14]I've been thinking...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_01 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Didn't Yusuke say he's the only[n]student living with Madarame?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_02 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]He did.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_03 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]But other people's paintings[n]were in that Palace too...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_04 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Plus that unlimited whatever[n]thingamajig said "they" on it too.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_05 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Anyways, something didn't add[n]up, so I looked into it.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_06 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Turns out, Madarame used to[n]have tons more students![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_07 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]So does that mean...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_08 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]The site I found said[n]they "graduated" from[n]studying under him.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_09 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]There ain't a chance in[n]hell that's true though.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_10 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]They prolly ran away cause of[n]how bad he was treating them![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_11 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Kitagawa-kun must know[n]about that as well...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_12 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Well duh.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_13 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Why's he still all buddy buddy[n]with that dick Madarame though?[n][w][e]
