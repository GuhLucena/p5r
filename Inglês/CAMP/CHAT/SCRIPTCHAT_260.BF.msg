[s][f 5 14]About that virtual currency[n]investment scammer... She's[n]turned herself in.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_001_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]And the money?[e]
[s]What about the victims?[e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Most of the money she swindled[n]was apparently untouched in her[n]accounts.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]So most of it can be returned to[n]the buyers.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_003_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]That's good.[e]
[s]All thanks to you.[e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]It certainly is. And they have you[n]and the rest of the team to thank[n]for it.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]No, it wasn't just me. You and the[n]rest of the team made this happen.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]I hope we can keep helping[n]people in need like this.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Let's do just as well next[n]time, too.[n][w][e]
