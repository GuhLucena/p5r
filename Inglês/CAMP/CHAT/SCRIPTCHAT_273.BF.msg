[s][f 5 14]We got a really scary request.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It says "Kill me"...[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_001_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]That sounds serious.[e]
[s]We don't do hits.[e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]It sounds like he's in a pretty bad[n]spot. The details are pretty ugly,[n]too...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]I know that! But we can't just[n]ignore it either, can we?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]The guy's name is[n]Nao Minamoto.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]He lost both his parents really[n]young, and he's had to take care[n]of his little sister ever since.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]He's been working really hard at[n]a part-time job to support them[n]both, but...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Right now, he hates his sister[n]so much that he can't take it.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]She's his only family, but... he[n]can't control how he feels.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]At some point, he was so mad he[n]shoved her, but she stumbled,[n]and...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]...I guess she got hurt really[n]badly.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It was an unfortunate accident,[n]but he says he can't accept[n]that...[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_005_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]So it's a penance thing?[e]
[s]Is his sister okay?[e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah. He wants to be stopped[n]before he kills his family.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]It seems like she's fine.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]He just thinks... There's no[n]guarantee it won't go worse next[n]time. He'd rather just be killed.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]But changing his heart is bound[n]to help somehow, right!?[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]You need to kill off those negative[n]feelings inside of him![n][w][e]
