[s][f 5 14]Man, that Nakanohara guy[n]was a piece of cake![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]If we can take down some kinda[n]big target next, we're totally[n]gonna get famous.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Hey! We're trying to help[n]people, not get famous![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]But if people don't know who[n]we are, how're we gonna give[n]them any courage?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_004_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]He's right.[e]
[s]Are you sure, Ryuji?[e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]See?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Am I wrong?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I don't think that you're[n]necessarily wrong...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]But should we really be doing[n]this at all if we don't have[n]a reason like with Kamoshida?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]You mean we shouldn't be[n]sticking our noses into[n]other people's business?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I dunno, man. If someone's in[n]trouble, it's only natural[n]to wanna help 'em out![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I mean, I agree with that.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]And I guess I was glad we were[n]able to solve the stalker case.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Plus, what good are our Personas[n]if we don't use 'em for good?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Don't you agree, [f 4 2]?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_015_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Definitely.[e]
[s]I want to help people.[e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah... You're right.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]The same goes for me.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]We don't got much time to be[n]arguing over this either. That[n]Madarame(?) guy bothers me.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah. But no getting carried[n]away, you understand?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]And don't do anything to stand[n]out like fail all your exams.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Oh crap! Speaking of that, I[n]haven't studied at all...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]What about that star? The[n]one Jose gave us.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_023_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Wonder if that could help[n]us ace the exams...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_024_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, somehow I doubt that.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_025_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Hell, I'd settle for just[n]not failing.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_026_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Bargaining isn't gonna help you[n]here. We wouldn't use it for[n]that in the first place.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_027_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Maybe you should just, I dunno,[n]put some actual effort in?[n]You've still got time.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_028_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Fiiine...[n][w][e]
