[s]She's glued to her PC.[e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]So she woke up OK.[n]I'm glad to hear that.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]And considering that phrasing...[n]I assume she's helping us out?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]So she's already helping us.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]For real? C'mon, you gotta[n]tell us this shit sooner.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ann]]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]But what is she planning...?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_009_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]I don't know.[e]
[s]Let's leave it to Futaba.[e]
[s]Cyber-warfare.[e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I guess we'll just have to leave[n]this in Futaba-chan's hands...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]I only hope this can[n]settle the matter...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]It'll be OK, right?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]We just have to believe in her.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Ryuji]]
