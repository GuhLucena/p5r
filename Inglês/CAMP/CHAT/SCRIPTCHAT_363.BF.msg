[s][f 5 14]How'd it go?[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Did Ann's acting help at all?[n]I'm thinking prolly not.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]It went perfectly, I think![n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]More importantly, were you able[n]to find anything, [f 4 2]?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_002_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]It's drugs.[e]
[s]It's trafficking.[e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]So they ask you[n]to deliver drugs...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]That's serious.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I just searched for "Shibuya[n]drugs" and got tons of hits too.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]That's serious.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I just searched for[n]"Shibuya trafficking"[n]and got tons of hits too.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]So they're making people traffic[n]drugs, then threatening them...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]That must be what I heard[n]people talking about in Shibuya.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]They seem to be going about this[n]quite openly during the daytime.[n]What bold methodology.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I would've imagined they would[n]do it at night... I wonder why[n]they chose the day.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_010_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]They go for high schoolers.[e]
[s]They need to blend in.[e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]I see.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Yes, more students will be out[n]during the day, while the police[n]will be more cautious at night.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Ryuji, you're over in Shibuya[n]now, right? Do you see anyone[n]like that there?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, I'm at Central Street.[n]It's tough to tell though.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I mean, there're just way too[n]many people. The goddamn rain's[n]not helping out either.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]The sun will be setting soon.[n]What should we do, [f 4 2]?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_015_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Let's do this tomorrow.[e]
[s]Let's stop for today.[e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, that seems like our only[n]choice now. We can split up and[n]search separately then.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah. We can team up and[n]try searching again tomorrow.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I bet Ryuji would get picked[n]up by the cops if he was out[n]there alone anyway.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Shuddup.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]In any case, we have some[n]new intel. Let us call that[n]progress for today.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Whoever asks us to take on[n]that job should know who[n]their boss is too.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]All right, I'll get in touch[n]with you guys later tonight and[n]we can come up with a plan.[n][w][e]
