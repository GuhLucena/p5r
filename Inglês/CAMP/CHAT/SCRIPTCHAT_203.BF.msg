[s][f 5 14]Picked up some interesting info[n]you might want to hear...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Apparently there's this old man[n]who's been causing problems in[n]Kichijoji.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]If you make one wrong move or[n]say the wrong thing, he flies into a[n]rage and it turns into a fight.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Even if you don't hit him, he lies[n]and says you didâ€”and then sues[n]for damages.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]So he's like a con artist! Or like...[n]a conflict artist.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_001_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]That's ridiculous.[e]
[s]And the cops?[e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]I agree. We can't let this guy[n]go unchecked.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Well, they tried to give him[n]a warning...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]But when he pretends to be[n]senile, he gets away with[n]everything.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]We can't just let him go[n]unchecked, right?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Only problem is, knowing that he's[n]an old troublemaker isn't enough[n]to get us a name...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]But I DID hear that he hangs out[n]in Kichijoji's Harmony Alley a lot![n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 2 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1021 65535 0]This old man sure does sound like[n]a problem.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 3 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 65535 0]And if we don't know his name, we can't[n]make him have a change of heart.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 65535 0]Okay, it sounds like our next stop is[n]Kichijoji. Let's go check out this[n]Harmony Alley![n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
