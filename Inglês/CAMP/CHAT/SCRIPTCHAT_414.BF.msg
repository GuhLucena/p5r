[s][f 5 14]What do we do about that[n]cheater? Ain't we screwed if[n]our attacks can't do anything?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_quest27_01 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]He is invincible at his[n]game, so he is invincible[n]in Mementos as well...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_quest27_02 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Then how about we just beat[n]him at that game of his? Oh,[n]but he'll just cheat...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_quest27_03 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]How 'bout we ask for help[n]from a skilled player?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_quest27_04 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Supposedly there's an insanely[n]good gamer they call the "King"[n]somewhere in this city.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_quest27_05 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]I've seen all over the forums how[n]he managed to beat this cheater[n]himself with orthodox methods.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_quest27_06 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]For real!? Where can we find him?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_quest27_07 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]I checked his account[n]from the official server...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_quest27_08 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]But I couldn't pinpoint what[n]arcade he goes to. Sorry...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_quest27_09 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]But if he's really that famous,[n]won't it be easy to find him?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_quest27_10 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]That's true. OK, we should[n]gather intel on the King at[n]the arcades around the city.[n][f 5 15][w][e]
