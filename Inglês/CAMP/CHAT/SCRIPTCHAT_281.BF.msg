[s][f 5 14]About the actualization...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Did something happen?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]One of my fellow artists no longer[n]works in the medium.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]You mean they gave up painting?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]To be precise, their entire history[n]and existence as a painter are[n]no more.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]For real!?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Actualization sure is some spooky[n]stuff...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]But doesn't that mean Maruki[n]just killed their dream?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Noâ€”in this reality, they have[n]apparently always been in[n]archery.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]They're quite skilled as well,[n]from what I've gathered.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_1 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Seriously? But... why archery?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_2 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]I don't know the exact reasoning,[n]but it was most likely Maruki's[n]judgment call.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_3 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]He pried into your associate's[n]cognition and concluded archery[n]to be the best fit for them.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_4 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]So that's what Dr. Maruki[n]considers "salvation"...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_5 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]He probably concluded that[n]the arts were just generating[n]suffering for them...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_6 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]I suppose he thought this would[n]be a superior path?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Now that you mention it, they did[n]say before that they were stuck in[n]a terrible slump...  [n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]But doesn't that mean all of the[n]effort up until now is just...[n]wasted?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Protecting people from their pain[n]must matter more than their lost[n]efforts.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]From his point of view, of course.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_018_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]A real utopia...[e]
[s]What a hellhole.[e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]It may be to them... but not to me.[n]I could never live with myself[n]like that.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]I couldn't have put it better myself.[n]It's so pretentious, it's nauseating.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 2 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1044 65535 0]Throwing away your past to live in[n]blissful ignorance...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Yeah, I could never live like that either.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
