[s][f 5 14]The mom made a post on[n]the Phan-Site![n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I guess she checked her history[n]and found her daughter's posts.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]She apologized for everything.[n]They're taking a family trip to an[n]amusement park, too.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]She sounds more coherent than[n]before, too. I think she's all better![n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]Glad that worked out.[e]
[s]Good for the girl.[e]

[s][f 5 14]Yeah![n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I bet she got a nice big hug[n]from her mom.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]...I'm almost a little jealous.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Uh, almost.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1028 65535 0]Heh. You'd think she would be a little[n]more honest with herself.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 65535 0]But if you think about it... we'd never[n]have fixed this without Futaba.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 2 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 65535 0]If we'd just passed it off as a false alarm,[n]who knows how much worse their lives[n]would have gotten?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 1 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1166 65535 0]Futaba picked up on that cry for help.[n]She was kind enough to fight for them.[n]That's how we saved that family.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
