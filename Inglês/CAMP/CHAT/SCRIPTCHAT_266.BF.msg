[s][f 5 14]The Miracle X salesman issued an[n]apology. He's admitted the drink[n]has no medicinal properties.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]He's refunding anyone who asks,[n]and it sounds like he plans to make[n]truly healthy products now.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Miracle X itself tastes fine, so he[n]plans to sell it as an ordinary[n]refreshment. 1,000 yen a bottle.[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]Anyone buying?[e]
[s]1,000 yen's not bad.[e]

[s][f 5 14]You know... Many of the ones[n]buying his stock now are the same[n]ones who claimed to be cured.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I suppose once you experience a[n]"miracle," it's hard to let go. Even[n]if there's no scientific evidence.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Ah, but in any case, the situation[n]is now resolved. Thank you, Joker![n][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Not like that's reliable, though, so[n]it's best to go to a doctor whenever[n]you need it.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
