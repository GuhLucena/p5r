[s][f 5 14]We have some developments in[n]that case with the falsely accused.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It sounds like the charge against[n]Toji Karataki is being dropped.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]That's great![n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Looks like the change of heart[n]worked![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah! And now Toji's gonna[n]get released![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]I suggest you let me finish before[n]you start celebrating.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]What?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_006_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]What's the catch?[e]
[s]There's more?[e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]The charge for assault has[n]been dropped, as I said.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Which leaves Toji Karataki open[n]for an entirely different charge:[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Extortion.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]What!?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Hey, what the hell happened?[n]Are you behind this shit!?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Don't misunderstand me.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]The truth of the matter is that he is[n]not the poor, innocent victim you[n]saw him as.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]And that, really, is the point.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Allow me to clarify...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]First, the key that Ushiwata's[n]Shadow left behind was the key to[n]a safe deposit box at a bank.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Inside said box was crucial data[n]proving him guilty of tax evasion.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It seems this went on for several[n]years during his tenure as the[n]cabinet minister's secretary.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Ushiwata was committing tax[n]evasion? Wait, so you mean the[n]extortion was...?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Yes. Toji Karataki was using that[n]information to threaten Ushiwata.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]All in an attempt to take revenge[n]against his own flesh and blood,[n]most likely.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It seems that the real key to the safe[n]was hidden in the teddy bear.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]So... he wasn't panicking cause he[n]was worried about losing his[n]memories of his mom...?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]I imagine the continued threats[n]eventually pushed Ushiwata to his[n]limit. Thus, the assault charge.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 3 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1112 65535 0]So while Toji was in custody, he stole[n]the key to the safe deposit box...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1112 65535 0]That must mean he planned to steal[n]the evidence in the safe too...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]So he wasn't keeping silent out[n]of fear...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]It was out of self-preservation.[n]To expose Ushiwata would have[n]been to expose his own extortion.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]A couple months of silence, doing[n]his time? He could simply wait that[n]out and begin his extortion anew.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]But after the change of heart,[n]Morozumi confessed everything.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]All guilty parties have been[n]arrested, including Karataki. And[n]that is how this case ends.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]What the hell...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Akechi... Did you know all this[n]would come out? Have you known[n]from the beginning?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Should I have?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_023_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]You were the one who brought[n]this case up in the first place, right?[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I could see you gathering all the[n]necessary information and coming[n]to this conclusion on your own.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_024_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Are you suggesting he brought this[n]case to us knowing all of them[n]would be punished?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_025_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]While I'm flattered that you view[n]my deductive skills so highly...[n]I didn't know everything for sure.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I have to say, though...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It was astounding to see you all so[n]ready to accept the victim as some[n]blameless paragon of virtue.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_026_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]You bastard![n][w][e]

[sel SEL_027_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]So this was all a trick?[e]
[s]Why did you do it?[e]

[msg MSG_028_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]This is my wake-up call to[n]the rest of you.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Not everyone has the luxury of[n]being heroes of their own story.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]If you let yourself trust other[n]people that easily, that blindly,[n]it's going to get you hurt someday.[n][w][e]
