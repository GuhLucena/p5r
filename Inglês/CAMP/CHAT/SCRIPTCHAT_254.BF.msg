[s][f 5 14]Yo, I just checked the Phan-Site.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]There's some kinda thread on there[n]looking for info about burglars[n]using the Phantom Thieves name.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Sounds pretty lame to me.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Oh, I saw that too. They[n]target restaurants, right?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I actually found a really[n]interesting post on there.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]"My brother has suddenly started[n]acting violent towards everyone."[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]"I might end up getting[n]killed at this rate..."[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]"I wonder if it's because he[n]got caught up with all those[n]weird people in Shibuya."[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]You think he means those[n]burglars when he's talking[n]about them "weird people"?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]It may be too soon to assume that.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]The post said he started spending[n]a bunch of money lately, too...[n]Isn't that kind of suspicious?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I wonder how many burglar groups[n]there even are in Shibuya...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Damn, things're really[n]starting to get serious.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[sel SEL_020_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Let's look into it.[e]
[s]It's probably a false tip.[e]
[s]What should we do?[e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I thought you'd say that.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_023_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]I wish we could deny it, but we just can't[n]be sure.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_024_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I guess I'm interested.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_027_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Although how exactly will we[n]go about investigating?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_028_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]We'll go to Shibuya in the[n]middle of the night and catch[n]them all red-handed![n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_030_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]No way. The police'd totally[n]nab us if we were out that late.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_034_0_0 [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]Plus it would be bad if the chief knew[n]you were out in the middle of the night.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_037_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Hm, if they target restaurants...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Aha! What if we drew[n]them to Leblanc?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_038_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]What!?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_049_0_0 [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 5 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 65535 1020 0 0]There's no way... Who would go after[n]a shop like this?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_040_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Wouldn't that cause a lot[n]of trouble for Boss?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_050_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]"Leblanc Targeted!" It seems[n]like a viable plan to me...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[sel SEL_044_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Let's do it.[e]
[s]That's a horrible idea.[e]

[msg MSG_045_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Cut it out![n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]You'd get kicked outta[n]Leblanc if we failed![n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_047_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Yup.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I mean, you'd get kicked[n]outta Leblanc if we failed.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_043_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Oh, I suppose I left the "Sayuri"[n]there as well. I had forgotten.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_052_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]How'd you forget something[n]that important!?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_042_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Either way...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I don't really want more thieves[n]to be posing as us in the future.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I wish there was some way[n]we could make an example[n]of these ones...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_039_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]At the moment, our lack of info[n]means we will just have to wait.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]We can continue searching[n]for more information wherever[n]possible, though.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_029_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_041_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]I'm gonna try looking[n]for stuff too![n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 3 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1021 65535 0]That group seems like a perfect[n]Mementos target, don't you think?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]Though without any intel, we'll just[n]have to wait and see...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
