[s][f 5 14]I tried looking Shido's[n]interviews up online. They[n]all sound so goddamn fake.[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]I checked his profile as well,[n]but I couldn't find much outside[n]of his title and education.[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]Shido's a cabinet[n]minister!? For real!?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_5_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]He was specially appointed[n]to the position. That's his[n]current title.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Apparently he also won a contest[n]for who people would most like[n]to have as their boss.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Even the news sites write about[n]him as though he's assured to[n]become the prime minister.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]If only we could find out the[n]meaning behind Shido's words...[n][w][e]
