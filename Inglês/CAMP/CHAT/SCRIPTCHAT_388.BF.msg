[s][f 5 14]Goddammit. People're acting like[n]we were the ones who killed 'em.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]I have even heard them say we[n]are assassins hired to deal with[n]psychotic breakdown victims.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Ugh, that's obviously not[n]what we're trying to do.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]This must be part of the[n]plan to shift the blame[n]onto the Phantom Thieves.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]After all, the true culprit[n]is the one killing the people[n]on that ranking list.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_005_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]This is unforgivable.[e]
[s]This is total BS.[e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Indeed. I have no intentions[n]of letting this slide.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]But that is the truth for the[n]general public at the moment.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Man, this culprit guy[n]really won't let up.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]I don't remember ever doing[n]anything that'd make someone[n]hate us THIS much.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]He used my father as well...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]I cannot fathom what his motive[n]may be... We will just have to[n]capture and interrogate him.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]But before that, we need to[n]change my sister's heart.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]That's our first step[n]toward stopping him.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]I must agree. The true culprit[n]will be caught, but before that[n]we must deal with Sae-san.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]If ranking is being taken into[n]consideration, perhaps I will be[n]targeted too... Just kidding.[n][w][e]
