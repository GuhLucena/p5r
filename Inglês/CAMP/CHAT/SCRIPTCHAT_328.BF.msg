[s][f 5 14]Hey, I saw a weird post[n]on Mishima-kun's website.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_000_1_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Someone was thanking us for[n]a request we didn't do.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_000_2_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Plus it even had an[n]anonymous comment on it.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_000_3_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]"Helping the weak and crushing[n]the strong! The Phantom Thieves[n]are on your side!"[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_000_4_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]What is all this about?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Well, there have been a great[n]number of impersonators.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_5_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]It could all be a prank, yes?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_002_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]I don't know.[e]
[s]Let's see what happens.[e]
[s]Someone did that request.[e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Maybe I'm worrying too much.[n]I guess we'll just have to[n]wait and see what happens.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Maybe I'm worrying too much...[n]It's probably nothing.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah. The real question is, who?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_3_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Well, I guess we'll just have[n]to wait and see what happens.[n][w][e]
