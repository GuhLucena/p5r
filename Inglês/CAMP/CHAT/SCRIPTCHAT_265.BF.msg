[s][f 5 14]I found this request on the forum...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Do you know Miracle X? It's this[n]10,000 yen "miracle drink" that[n]can "cure any disease"...[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_001_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Does it work?[e]
[s]Sounds fishy.[e]
[s]What a bargain.[e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Well, some reports are saying it[n]really does. Though I can't speak[n]to their credibility.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]If it can truly cure any sickness,[n]that'd be amazing, of course...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]I agree. But even then, I've found[n]some reports saying it does work.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Some reports are saying it's had[n]incredible effects. Though I can't[n]speak to their credibility.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Who knows how much of it is true.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]But... this poster said their parent[n]drank it while sick. They only got[n]worse, and soon passed away...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]They apparently thought it was an[n]adequate substitute for hospital[n]care. So they stopped going...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]...If this is their intended business[n]model, to prey upon the sick and[n]weak... I cannot just stand by.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_006_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]That's terrible.[e]
[s]Very, very shady.[e]

[s][f 5 14]I've found the dealer's name on[n]his website. It's Takeo Saburi.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]He cannot be allowed to use food[n]and drink in the name of evil![n]We must see justice served![n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]...The only problem is... we have[n]no proof that it truly is a scam.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_008_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]No proof?[e]
[s]Why, does it actually work?[e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Well, some people claim online[n]that the drink DID cure them.[n]They may well be shills, but...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]If he truly has made some[n]medicinal breakthrough, it would[n]be wrong to change his heart...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]...So, rather than act immediately,[n]I think we should gather some[n]information first.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_010_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Let's investigate.[e]
[s]Let's ask around.[e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Most of Miracle X's supporters[n]seem to be elderly. Perhaps there's[n]someone in Yongen who knows it?[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]I'll do some more research online,[n]so Yongen is yours to search![n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]If it's really a scam, we can't let this[n]keep happening. Let's go try talking to[n]older folks over in Yongen.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s]When investigating requests, you may find that[n]you can change a target's heart nonviolently by[n]speaking up mid-battle.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s]For this to succeed, you will need to gather[n]information in the real world.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s]Speak to the townspeople and collect information[n]that will aid in changing the target's heart.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
