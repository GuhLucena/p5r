[s][f 5 14]That kid made another post[n]on the Phan-Site.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]"Mom and dad aren't gonna[n]get divorced anymore!"[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]They sound so happy, man! I guess[n]the mom and dad finally got to[n]talkin' things out.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]The three of 'em have a little[n]family trip planned next weekend.[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]That's good news.[e]
[s]They can see Lily-Nyan.[e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah. Glad we made a difference.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]If you've got a dad you can trust,[n]one who really feels like family...[n]that's gotta feel great.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Sure, that could be fun. Long as[n]the family's together, right?[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Wait, "Lily-Nyan"? What the hell?[n]When did you become a fan?[n][w][e]
