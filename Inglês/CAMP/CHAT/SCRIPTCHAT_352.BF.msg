[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]You must surely be exhausted.[n]I suggest you go to sleep early.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Hey, we should talk about[n]Haru's welcome party![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Didn't we just say we would[n]let her rest, you dimwit!?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]I appreciate your concern,[n]but I'm OK. I promise.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]As long as you're OK, Haru...[n]Well, is there anywhere you'd[n]like to go?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Actually, I'd like to walk[n]around the school festival[n]with everyone.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]You mean the Shujin school[n]festival? I must admit, I[n]am interested as well.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_009_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Then it's settled.[e]
[s]I can't wait.[e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]That reminds me, we still[n]haven't settled on a guest.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]A guest!?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Like, some kinda celebrity!?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Wait, does that mean the[n]Phantom Thieves could be[n]one of the candidates!?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]How 'bout it? Wanna show up?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]That's a bit over the top...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]You're getting way[n]too carried away.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Don't say such strange things.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]What a shallow idea.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Oooh, a four-hit combo![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Sorry...[n][w][e]
