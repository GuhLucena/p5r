[s][f 5 14]Hm, it seems police have[n]shown up at our school.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]The police? What for?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Your sister hasn't told[n]you about any of this?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Nothing at all.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Could this be related to[n]Okumura's death in some way?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]But there's no connection between[n]our school and Okumura Foods.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Think they came to talk to Haru?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]She's... absent today.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Then seriously, what're[n]they here for?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]I can't even begin to[n]fathom the reason.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Anyhow, let's be particularly[n]careful not to stand out.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]And head straight home[n]once school ends.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Understand that, everyone?[n][w][e]
