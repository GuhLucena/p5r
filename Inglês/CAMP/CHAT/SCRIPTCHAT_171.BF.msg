[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]That leaves me with nothing![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]We are preparing for our school[n]trips. None of us have the time[n]to entertain you right now.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Oh, shoot! I need to go shopping![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]All we need is a toothbrush,[n]right? What're you panicking for?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]There's a lot I need! Shampoos,[n]lotions, conditioners...![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Ah, that reminds me... I should[n]pack a canvas. This trip will be[n]a prime painting opportunity.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Will one be enough though...?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_010_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]That's more than enough.[e]
[s]You don't need it.[e]
[s]Why even bring one?[e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]No, I should bring three.[n]Inspiration may strike[n]at any moment in time...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]But I wouldn't be able to draw[n]anything. Perhaps I'll pack[n]three, just to be safe.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Drawing, of course. I will bring[n]three, including a spare.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Now regarding canvas size,[n]bigger is better, yes?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]What're you asking us for!?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]What I mean is, you shouldn't[n]take shit like that with you![n][w][e]
