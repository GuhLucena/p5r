[s][f 5 14]Got an update on the cat lady.[n]Sounds like she made a post on[n]the Phan-Site.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I guess she turned herself[n]in to the police.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Once she's paid for her crimes,[n]she's gonna do volunteer work to[n]help stray cats.[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]I agree.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I think she genuinely just wanted[n]to protect them.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1164 65535 0]I see... So Aino's started thinking[n]positively.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 65535 0]She probably doesn't remember me,[n]but maybe I'll visit her in the future.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 1 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1175 65535 0]...I made a promise, after all.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
