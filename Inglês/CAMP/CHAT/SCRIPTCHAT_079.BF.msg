[s][f 5 14]Hey, I heard some company's[n]info got leaked?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Yes, it seems the private[n]dealings of a large corporation[n]were publicly disclosed.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]It's caused quite the stir.[n]People are wondering if[n]Medjed is behind it.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_003_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Do you think it was Medjed?[e]
[s]That wasn't the promise.[e]
[s]Let's ignore that.[e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]I would think not.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Indeed. I doubt they'd do[n]anything before the deadline[n]they imposed on us.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]I agree.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]This seems to be just a minor[n]thing. Quite different from what[n]Medjed has done up until now.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Is that so?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]So it wasn't Medjed!? Damn,[n]that shit freaked me out![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]It's honestly kind of hard not[n]having a knee-jerk reaction to[n]this stuff nowadays...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Sometimes people react to these[n]situations by pleading for help[n]from the Phantom Thieves.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]We need to find a way to[n]stand up for them...[n][w][e]
