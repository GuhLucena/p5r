[s][f 5 14]I can't believe what's become[n]of Mementos...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]His power truly is tremendous.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I didn't even think Mementos[n]went that far down! The place[n]is friggin' huge![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Far up, more like. I lost track of[n]how long we spent on those[n]stairs...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]I know, right!? That place is not[n]made for a gamer physique...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]Maybe it's obvious, but when your[n]legs and feet get tired, stretching[n]always helps.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]And it might be good to massage[n]your pressure points, too.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Whoa, the athlete knows her stuff![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Makoto]]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]I'm actually just about to start my[n]training, yes![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]HOW!? Where does all that stamina[n]even come from...?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Well, it's your call. Just don't go[n]tiring yourself out.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]If you waste all your energy out of[n]combat, you're not just useless.[n]You're a liability.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Then I'll make sure not to push[n]myself too hard![n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 2 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1035 65535 0]Well, we'll have to get back to infiltrating[n]the Palace next time. I just hope our path[n]isn't blocked...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
