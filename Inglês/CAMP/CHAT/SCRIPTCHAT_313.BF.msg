[s][f 5 14]Oh, I just remembered![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14][f 4 2], were you able to ask[n]Boss about Futaba Sakura?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_002_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]He didn't want to talk.[e]
[s]I tried...[e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Could there be a reason[n]as to why that was?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]So, no results. Could there be[n]a reason as to why that was?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Hm. Alibaba might be our only[n]hope of defeating Medjed.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]I wish we could get some info[n]about Futaba out of Boss...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]But trying to force it[n]out would probably have[n]the opposite effect.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]To be honest, I owe a great[n]deal to both Boss and [f 4 2].[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]I don't wish for this to be a[n]source of discord between them.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, I know just what you mean![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]It's probably best to[n]wait for Boss to bring[n]the subject up himself.[n][w][e]
