[s][f 5 14]Our name did spread a bit[n]thanks to Madarame...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]But I bet people still wouldn't[n]care if we came out and said[n]we're the Phantom Thieves.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_002_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]You're right.[e]
[s]I'm not so sure.[e]
[s]Let's try it.[e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]I must agree.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]I doubt anyone would believe us.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Please don't. That may seem[n]like a fun idea for now...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]But what good would come of[n]telling people our identities?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Maybe they'd at least start[n]treating us with some respect.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Well, I can understand[n]why you feel that way...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]That's just how things are now,[n]but if we keep doing stuff like[n]this, that will definitely change.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]We simply need to devote[n]ourselves to the cause. Our[n]praise will come later.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]What he said![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I'm sure some people out[n]there will understand.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Ugh. I guess we just gotta act[n]like modest heroes for now...[n][w][e]
