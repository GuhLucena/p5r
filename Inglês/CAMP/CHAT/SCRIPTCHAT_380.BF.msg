[s][f 5 14]Hey, so are we boned if this[n]legal action goes through?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Madarame is a well-known[n]individual. The police will[n]surely move fast on his request.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]We will be arrested, and worst[n]comes to worst, sent to some[n]sort of juvenile hall.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]But I thought you said it[n]didn't seem like he'd actually[n]go through with it...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]That is true. He's been[n]bedridden since we went[n]through with it, after all.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Honestly though, it's difficult[n]to even tell if he's actually[n]undergone a change of heart.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I guess we'll just have to[n]wait until he recovers...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I don't feel good about that...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]I will contact you all at[n]once if anything happens.[n]Would that work for you?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_009_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]That'd be great.[e]
[s]Go for it.[e]
[s]Are you going to be OK?[e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Very well. I will try to keep[n]as close an eye on Madarame's[n]state as possible.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]There have been no issues so far,[n]so I expect the same is true of[n]the future. Don't worry about me.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Well then, see you.[n][w][e]
