[s][f 5 14]I assume you are all curious,[n]so I'm sending you an update,[n]just in case.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Madarame is still bedridden.[n]He hasn't spoken a single word.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]My apologies for not being able[n]to provide anything more solid...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]C'mon, it's not your fault.[n]Don't worry about it.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]...It is June already though.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]The exhibition will[n]be ending soon...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]At least it doesn't seem like[n]Madarame's had a mental shutdown.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]But there's no point if he don't[n]have a change of heart and call[n]off that legal action bullshit.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Was this how it was when[n]you defeated Kamoshida?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_009_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Pretty much.[e]
[s]Not exactly.[e]
[s]I don't remember.[e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, Kamoshida was out[n]of school for a while.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]You think so? Kamoshida did[n]confine himself in his home...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Kamoshida confined himself in[n]his home. I don't know if he[n]was bedridden though...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_1 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Was this how it was when[n]you defeated Kamoshida?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_009_0_1 top]
[s][f 5 14]I don't know.[e]
[s]Can't remember.[e]

[msg MSG_010_0_1 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]It's weird. Kamoshida's change of[n]heart felt really quick.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_1 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Kamoshida's change of heart[n]happened super fast.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_1 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Wish we had more info...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Either way, there has been[n]no palpable progress.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]It appears only the target[n]themselves can tell whether or[n]not their heart has changed.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]It's a goddamn pain[n]in the ass, but yeah.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]We just gotta hear from Madarame[n]himself what the deal is.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Yeah, there's nothing we can[n]really do... Let's just try[n]waiting a little longer.[n][w][e]
