[s][f 5 14]Yo, Akechi.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]What is it?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]You got any idea who the[n]true culprit might be?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Oh yeah! You said you saw[n]a masked guy, right?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]I wanted to ask about that too.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Did you really see him?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]That masked guy's gotta be[n]the true culprit, right?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]If this so-called true culprit[n]is acting alone, then there[n]can be no mistake about it.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]I see.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]The next question is, who[n]is that masked man?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Unfortunately, I do not[n]know that much.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Ugh, you're useless.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]That is quite harsh.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Aw, you're making me blush![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]That wasn't a compliment...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]At this point, I have yet[n]to even grasp any clues.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]But once this is dealt with,[n]I will surely capture him.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]I promise you that.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_018_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]We'll be counting on you.[e]
[s]Can you do it?[e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Perfect. Leave it to me.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Hm? Do you not trust me?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]It may sound somewhat odd for[n]me to say this, but I am an[n]exceptional detective.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]I assure you, I will catch this[n]culprit. Look forward to it.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 1 0 0]He doesn't have any clues, but he's[n]confident enough to say he can[n]definitely catch the guy...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 2 0 0]No wonder he's a star detective. Even[n]the way he talks about these things is[n]different from us.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
