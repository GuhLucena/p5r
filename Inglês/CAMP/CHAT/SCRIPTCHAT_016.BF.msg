[s][f 5 14]I guess it's the principal's idea.[n]Damage control after Kamoshida[n]scandaled up the school's rep.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Pretty sure "scandal"'s not a verb.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]But I get what you mean. Even the[n]counseling stuff seems like a[n]desperate move.[n][w][e]

[s]It's all annoying.[e]

[s][f 5 14]I've been hearing Maruki's "hot,"[n]"kind," "sensitive"... Basically[n]everyone thinks he's their type.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Whoa. I guess he's pretty[n]popular, then.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ann]]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Oh shit. I forgot.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]But I dunno... I don't really feel[n]like going. You know what I[n]mean, right, [f 4 2]?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_013_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]I already went.[e]
[s]He's a good counselor.[e]

[s][f 5 14]You should just go already.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]If your slacking draws attention[n]to us, we're the ones who'll have[n]to pay for it.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_1 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]You should just go already. Well,[n]you can't today, but... soon.[n][w][e]
