[s][f 5 14]We have a week before[n]the deadline.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Dammit. I can't relax.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I know what you mean...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Everything moved so fast when we[n]were up against that big evil deity[n]thing...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]But now, we have so much[n]time to think it over...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]I can't help but feel nervous.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Right? It's like "ugh, we've still[n]got a whole week left"...[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_008_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]I know the feeling.[e]
[s]Gotta be ready.[e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]It would be no exaggeration to say[n]that this time, the fate of the world[n]really is in our hands...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]I can certainly understand how[n]that's unnerving, but we need to[n]do all we can.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Whoa. You sound all tough[n]and leadery.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]It would be no exaggeration to say[n]that this time, the fate of the world[n]really is in our hands...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Like [f 4 2] says, we should[n]prepare as much as we can[n]before the time comes.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]However we feel about it, it's[n]only a single week.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]We just need to make sure we[n]don't go in with anything left[n]undone.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Ryuji, you better not panic like it's the[n]last day of summer break.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]"For real!? It's tomorrow? Aw,[n]crap! What do I dooooo!?"[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Y'know, like that.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, I could see that.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Hm. Fairly easy to imagine.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I'm not THAT bad, guys![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_023_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Either way, we should do all we[n]can, so we can go into this[n]with no regrets.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_024_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Thank you for getting us back[n]on track, Haru.[n][w][e]
