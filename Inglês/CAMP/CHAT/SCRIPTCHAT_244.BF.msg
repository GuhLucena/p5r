[s][f 5 14]Hey, apparently that assassin[n]completely disappeared from down[n]in the Shibuya underground![n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Some idiot who doesn't care about[n]his life went asking the homeless[n]guy down there during the day.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Though I will say, it's strange[n]that he said he "disappeared,"[n]and not that he "quit."[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_001_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]I see...[e]
[s]That is weird.[e]
[s]It's fine either way.[e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]You figured it out? I would[n]have expected nothing less.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]I'd guess that he had[n]multiple personalities.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Though that might be a little[n]bit of a far-fetched idea...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]I guess. Words are difficult, huh?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Anyway, the Phantom Thieves claim[n]victory over the evil assassin![n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]I'm sure even more people will[n]have their eyes on you now! I'll[n]be counting on you too![n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1175 65535 0]This one was pretty complicated,[n]don't you think?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]I guess Mementos is kinda the same way,[n]though...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MND_quest29_CLEAR_SELF]
[s][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]It seems we successfully[n]changed the target's heart.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
