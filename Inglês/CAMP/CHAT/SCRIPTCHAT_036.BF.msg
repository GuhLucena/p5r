[s][f 5 14]So I keep thinking about[n]what Nakanohara said...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Could he have been talking about[n]the famous artist Madarame?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_002_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]That sounds about right.[e]
[s]Probably not.[e]
[s]Nice catch.[e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Seconded.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Great. The name really[n]stood out to me...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I want to agree with you, but[n]that last name is rare...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Well, it is a pretty[n]rare last name.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah I mean, you guys ever heard[n]of someone else called Madarame?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]It's really not common at all.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]If what we heard is true,[n]Kitagawa-kun is studying[n]under a corrupt teacher.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]You mean a teacher who[n]treats people like tools.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Kitagawa-kun's life is[n]probably pretty terrible...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]We gotta look into this.[n][w][e]
