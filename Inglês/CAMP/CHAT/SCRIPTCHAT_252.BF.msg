[s][f 5 14]Do you hear those cries of joy?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_quest09_clear_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]I'm talking about the[n]sudden burst of posts we[n]just got on the Phan-Site.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It must be because of how[n]popular the Phantom Thieves are.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_031_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Good for them.[e]
[s]That's annoying.[e]
[s]It's all thanks to you.[e]

[msg MSG_032_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0][f 5 14]Right? Wait... Why are you talking[n]about it like you're not involved?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_033_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0][f 5 14]It's the same for me. I'm gonna[n]have to pull another all-nighter[n]because of this...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_034_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0][f 5 14]Me? I wouldn't mind hearing[n]that a little more often![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_035_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0][f 5 14]Anyway, let me tell you about[n]the most interesting thing[n]I've found so far.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Indiscriminate acts of[n]violence in Shibuya.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Pretty scary, huh? I can't find[n]much more than that though...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]All of the posts mention rumors[n]they heard in the underground mall[n]in Shibuya, but nothing else.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It's not super reliable...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It'd be good if we could find[n]out more about those rumors, but[n]my presence is limited to the web.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]You might want to try and[n]learn more on your own if[n]you're interested.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 2 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1020 65535 0]Hm... I guess we have no choice but[n]to look for details ourselves.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 65535 0]I suggest you [clr 2]infiltrate the underground[n]mall as a store employee[clr 27] if you want[n]more info.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MND_quest09_CLEAR_SELF]
[s]It seems we successfully[n]triggered a change of[n]heart in the target...[n][w][e]
