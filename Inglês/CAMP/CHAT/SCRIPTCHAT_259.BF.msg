[s][f 5 14]This request caught my eye[n]on the Phan-Site.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It's an investment scam. Some[n]kind of virtual currency scheme.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It sounds like they've already hit[n]too many victims to count...[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_001_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]I want in on this.[e]
[s]Scary.[e]
[s]Virtual currency?[e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Don't say that. It'd be dangerous[n]to profit off of something like this.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Very. I can't believe there are[n]people benefiting from this...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]It's a substitute for physical[n]currency used online.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I'm just mad that it's being used[n]as a tool to exploit people.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]The only problem is... there's[n]no evidence.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]The transactions are in person, so[n]even if the scammer runs off,[n]there's no record of purchase.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_006_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]The cops can't help, huh?[e]
[s]That's our cue.[e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Right. That's where we come in.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Yes. I don't think we can leave[n]this one to the police.[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]The target's name was on the[n]Phan-Site. It's Yuko Amai.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Let's meet up at the hideout[n]and discuss with everyone else.[n][w][e]
