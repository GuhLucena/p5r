[s][f 5 14]How many more days do we[n]got again? Aren't we cutting[n]this kinda close?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]It's honestly hard to focus with[n]all of this looming over us...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Totally. These lectures're just[n]going in one ear and out the other.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Sounds like business as[n]usual for you, Ryuji.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]I'd be glad to help you[n]study if you need it. I'm[n]a third-year, after all.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I wish I could say no, but I'm[n]in some deep shit here...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, I think I'll take you up on[n]that once we finish our mission...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Good point. Dividing our focus[n]between two dilemmas cannot be[n]good for us, psychologically.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Well, only ten days[n]remain. This may be our[n]most crucial moment yet.[n][w][e]
