[s][f 5 14]Looks like AIMaask's deleted[n]his whole video archive.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]But he's been putting up[n]apology vids in their place.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_001_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]So things worked out.[e]
[s]How's that going over?[e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah. Hopefully this'll help his[n]little brother feel better, too.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Well, the haters still hate him, but[n]it's not stirring shit up any more[n]than things already are.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I think the apologies are making[n]things at least a little better.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I saw another post on the[n]Phan-Site too.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]"My big brother apologized to[n]the rest of the family."[n]He sounds happy.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Wonderful! I'm glad everything[n]turned out all right in the end.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1192 65535 0]Looks like he gave everyone a proper[n]apology. That's great![n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 1 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 65535 0]Not that an apology is going to make[n]things instantly better, but... now it's up[n]to him to make things right.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
