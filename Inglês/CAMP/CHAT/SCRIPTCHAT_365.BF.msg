[sel SEL_002_00 top]
[s][f 5 14]Maybe a little.[e]
[s]Have you?[e]

[msg MSG_003_00 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Ah, so you've grasped something[n]already. As to be expected of[n]someone like you, [f 4 2].[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_01 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]We asked around, but there's no[n]knowing how many of those are[n]actual leads at this point.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_00 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Why don't we just go over the[n]intel we've gathered so far?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_00 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I'll start.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Supposedly some guy near the[n]accessway talking about some[n]kinda "strong drugs."[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I'm not counting on anything,[n]but I'll go check it out.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_00 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]As for me, I heard about someone[n]soliciting a "high-paying job" in[n]the station plaza.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Apparently they're mostly[n]targeting girls. I'll go[n]see what it's about.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_00 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]On my end, I heard there are[n]people saying strange things in[n]the back alley near the arcade.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Something about ice and[n]vegetables, and something[n]about snow tomorrow...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]I will go observe, just[n]in case. The arcade is on[n]Central Street, correct?[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 3 65535 0]All right, we should do what we can[n]to help them out.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 4 65535 0]I have no idea which of these leads[n]are real. Try going to the most[n]suspicious-sounding place.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
