[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]There's been something on[n]my mind for a while now...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]What's the deal?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]...Why is the Palace a space[n]station this time?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Huh? Why? Well, because...[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_004_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]'Cause "Galaxy Burger."[e]
[s]He sees his company that way.[e]
[s]His heart is a space station.[e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Uh, yeah. It's gotta be 'cause[n]of Galaxy Burger, right?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]But that's only a single[n]product of theirs, isn't it?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]A single hamburger does not[n]birth a whole space station.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Uh, yeah! Cause he sees his[n]company as a space station.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Ah, and so this in turn inspired[n]the "Galaxy Burger"?[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]But why would his building[n]be a space station...?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Y-Yeah! Because his heart is[n]a space station![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]His what? I am no stranger to[n]metaphor, but... how is that[n]supposed to make sense?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]How the hell should I know?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]It's true, though. This Palace is[n]kinda weird compared to the[n]ones so far.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Kamoshida's castle... Madarame's[n]museum... Kaneshiro's bank...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Right... Futaba's was an exception,[n]but for the others...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Every Palace we've seen has[n]been a materialization of[n]the ruler's desires, right?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Does Haru's father like space[n]that much?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]I don't think so... I've never[n]seen anything like that[n]from him before...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]He sees his employees as robots,[n]which influences their function in[n]his Palace. This much we know.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]...But even then, what possible logic[n]could be behind forming his[n]Palace into a space station?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Because space stations are cool as[n]hell? I legitimately do not see the[n]confusion here, Yusuke.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]There is intent and meaning in all[n]things' forms. If this form is[n]distorted, there must be a reason.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Is it that big a deal?[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I mean, even if it is, we'll probably[n]find out at the end of all this.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]If that's true, I'd certainly like to[n]know. Let us make haste and[n]clear our path through.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Well, regardless of the symbolism,[n]we still need to secure a route.[n][w][e]
