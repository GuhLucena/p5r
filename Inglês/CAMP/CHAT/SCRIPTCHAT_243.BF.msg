[s][f 5 14]Hey, sorry for bringing this up[n]when things are so chaotic...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I know it's been tough after[n]what happened to President[n]Okumura and all...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]But this is the perfect time[n]for smaller changes of heart to[n]restore your reputation.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Anyway, here's the info I have...[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]Hey, sorry to bring this up now.[n]I know you have your hands full...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]But [f 4 28] can do it.[n]I have faith in all of you.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Anyway, here's the info I have...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_154_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]If true, this one is pretty crazy.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Apparently an ex-mercenary who[n]works as an assassin is hiding[n]out in the Shibuya underground.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]He acts like a homeless person[n]during the day, but then goes[n]about his "work" at night.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]He hasn't left any trace of[n]his identity though, so there's[n]nothing the police can do.[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]Sounds dangerous.[e]
[s]Hey, everyone's gotta work.[e]

[msg MSG_157_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]How can you accept that!?[n]Killing people is not OK![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_158_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]You really are brave...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_159_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Well, according to the rumors,[n]his name is Yohei Kiritani.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I'm seriously scared. I don't[n]want anything to do with this...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]I'm leaving this to you,[n][f 4 28]![n][w][e]
