[s][f 5 14]Ah, the hibiscus. Truly a flower of[n]singular beauty. The vivid color[n]compliments the water, too.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Right? Too bad Ryuji had[n]to ruin the shot.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Dude, get real! A guy can't wear[n]a flower in his hair! It's weird![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]I dunno, the guy next to you[n]wears it like a champ.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 19]Oh, one more to share.[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]The heck is that!? It's intense![n]Not my style, though.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]If you're going to be that rude[n]about it, I'm not lending it to you.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Wait... you actually bought[n]that thing?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Yes. For sketching purposes.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]You're kidding. Did you seriously[n]have the cash for that?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]When I showed them how much[n]money I had, they lowered the[n]price. Truly, a land of generosity...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Wow. That's like... a max-level[n]haggling maneuver.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]For real. Man, I wish I'd gotten[n]a price cut.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]It was nothing of the sort. I simply[n]expressed my passion to them.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Language barriers are surprisingly[n]easy to break through, as long as[n]you can convey your feelings...[n][w][e]
