[s][f 5 14]Hey, have you heard of this[n]"A.I. Mask" guy?[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Well, "AIMaask OUZI," I guess.[n]Some extreme video streamer with[n]a robot mask and a big audience.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]We got a request on the Phan-Site[n]from someone who knows him in[n]real life.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]One of the streamer's friends?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Apparently they want him to stop[n]streaming himself going around[n]doing borderline illegal stuff.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]When anyone tries to talk him out[n]of it, he flips out and gets violent.[n]They say he's out of control.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_003_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]We'd better stop him.[e]
[s]Do we have a name?[e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]I agree.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]So if we have word from one of[n]his personal contacts, does that[n]mean we know his name?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, about that. He says he's not[n]gonna post the guy's info online.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I guess this AIMaask OUZI guy has[n]pissed off a lot of people. If he got[n]doxxed, things could get ugly.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]So we only have his title, then...[n]or screenname, or whatever.[n]How can we get more hints?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]I'm looking at his archives now.[n]A lot of these streams seem to be[n]from Kichijoji.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]If we check around in Kichijoji,[n]maybe talk to some students,[n]we might learn something.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Students, huh? So our best shot is[n]probably weekday afternoons.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]But Kichijoji isn't the only place he[n]visits. It couldn't hurt to check[n]other locations too.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Okay, then let's all look around![n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]We'll leave Kichijoji to you,[n][f 4 2].[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 3 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1021 65535 0]So he's doing borderline illegal stuff in[n]some goofy mask? Cramping our style,[n]AND making life hard for people...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 65535 0]We gotta shut this guy down, for all[n]their sakes too![n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
