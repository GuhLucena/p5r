[s][f 5 14]This isn't much of an update...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]But I think I'm going to go back[n]to school, starting tomorrow.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]I'm sorry for worrying all[n]of you until now.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Are you really OK though?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Be sure not to push yourself[n]too hard in this time of grief.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]No, I actually need to push[n]myself. My mind always wanders[n]if I have nothing to do...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, I totally get you.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Besides... there's nothing[n]I can do while I'm at home.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Well, uh... I dunno how to[n]put it, but try not to think[n]about that stuff too much.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_009_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Count on us any time.[e]
[s]We're on your side, Haru.[e]

[msg MSG_0010_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, you don't have to worry[n]about asking us for anything![n]We're all here for you![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_1 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, you can come to us for[n]anything![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Um... To be completely honest...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]When I ended up alone... I[n]did doubt you all a tiny bit.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]But it's so horrible for me to[n]doubt you. I mean, I'm the one[n]who asked you all to do this.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Your father just passed away,[n]Haru. It's natural to feel a[n]flood of emotion at such events.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, it's really hard when[n]you lose someone like that...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]But I'm OK now. You've all[n]helped me out so much.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Right back at ya![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Thank you. Those words[n]are truly reassuring.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Well then, I'll see[n]all of you at school.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 3 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 1 0 0]Haru... I'm not surprised she seems[n]down. You should keep her in your[n]thoughts, [f 4 2].[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 2 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 2 0 0]Still, despite how she looks, Haru has[n]quite the backbone. I'm sure she'll be[n]okay.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
