[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Mm-hm. He asked me to[n]come by tomorrow.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Awww yeah, he fell for it![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0530 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]We got that cleanup thing[n]tomorrow, right?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_1_0530 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I guess we'll just have to go[n]home after, get changed, and[n]get to it![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Um, do I... really have[n]to do this...?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_004_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Just be careful.[e]
[s]It's the only way.[e]
[s]Strip for him, Ann.[e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I know, but still...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I AM NOT STRIPPING![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Man, this is such a pain...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]We gotta open that door AND[n]have Madarame see it, right?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah. Morgana said that'll[n]change his cognition.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I don't get it...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Oh, and one more thing.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Let us know if any weird shit[n]goes down and we'll be there[n]to back you up ASAP.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Kk, got it.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 1 0 0]A Palace is a reflection of how its owner[n]views the real world.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 2 0 0]So, if Madarame's cognition of reality[n]changes, it's only natural that his Palace[n]would be affected.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 2 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 3 0 0]And all jokes aside, we really will need[n]Lady Ann to strip for Yusuke. It's the only[n]way.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
