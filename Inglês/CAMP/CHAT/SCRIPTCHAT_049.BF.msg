[s][f 5 14]We were finally able to get[n]into the main assembly hall.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]That means we're ready to[n]send the calling card too.[n]When should we do it?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]We must consider the method by[n]which we will send it as well.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]All those guys cheering for[n]Shido better be ready.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]We're gonna surprise the[n]shit outta them![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]I can't wait for this.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]BTW, where's Makoto? She's[n]in this chat, right?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Yes, don't worry. I've[n]been reading it.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_008_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Is something wrong?[e]
[s]You seem anxious.[e]
[s]What's on your mind?[e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Well...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]It's about Akechi-kun, is it[n]not? That was really sad what[n]happened to him...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Honestly, I have mixed feelings...[n]but I think he was a victim too.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]A victim we couldn't save...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Had I not met you all, I may[n]have become like him as well...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Personally speaking, I[n]can't forgive the guy.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]But more importantly, I can't[n]forgive Shido for warping his[n]mind so goddamn much![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]I must agree. What Shido[n]did is reprehensible.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]We must do this. I'm certain[n]we'll be able to pull it off.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_018_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Let's do this.[e]
[s]I'm certain too.[e]
[s]It'll be just like always.[e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]You can count on us. The decision[n]on when to call us together for[n]this plan is on you, [f 4 2].[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Yeah, definitely. You're in[n]charge of picking the time[n]for us to do this, [f 4 2]![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Yes, it's best not to get too[n]worked up over this. As for the[n]timing, that is on you, [f 4 2].[n][w][e]
