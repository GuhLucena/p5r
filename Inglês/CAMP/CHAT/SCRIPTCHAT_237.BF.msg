[s][f 5 14]Got some kinda spooky info here.[n]It might be a serious problem.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Remember that blackmail stuff[n]from before? With Kaneshiro's[n]group?[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Thanks to the Phantom Thieves,[n]that outfit's history. But...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It sounds like a different group's[n]stepped in, and they're trying to[n]do the same thing![n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Apparently they're pretty small-[n]timeâ€”not a huge threat yet. But[n]their victims have been posting.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]We can't just let these scumbags[n]do whatever they want, can we?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_001_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]We should crush them.[e]
[s]They seem scary...[e]
[s]Do whatever you want.[e]

[s][f 5 14]I knew you'd say that![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]These guys'll be a piece of cake[n]compared to Kaneshiro![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]All right, then I will![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]The way I see it, the best way to[n]keep pests from popping up is to[n]make an example of them.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]I wrote a post saying the Phantom[n]Thieves are taking action, so the[n]rest is up to you![n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Take out their boss before[n]their group gets too big![n][w][e]
