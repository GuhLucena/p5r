[s][f 5 14]Things have become somewhat[n]troublesome, everyone.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Just try to stay calm.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]What's wrong?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Sis told me she's been entrusted[n]with an important task regarding[n]the Phantom Thieves.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]That means...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Yes... The SIU must surely[n]be on the move at this point.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_006_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]So what?[e]
[s]That's bad.[e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Wait, weren't they already[n]investigating us though?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]The police were doing so in[n]secret. This operation is on[n]a much different scale.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Hold on a sec. What's this[n]SIU thing anyways?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]The Special Investigations Unit.[n]An elite team that deals with huge[n]cases like government scandals.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]I have heard that name on the[n]news. They make headlines often.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]The real insane part is, they[n]haven't lost a case against[n]a suspect in like fifty years.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]If they come after you, you're[n]screwed. They're the best[n]investigation force in Japan.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Are we going to be arrested...?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Hm, doesn't this countermeasure[n]seem somewhat extreme?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Right or wrong, I think we're[n]just way too famous at this point.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]As this is a country governed by[n]law, they can't afford to ignore[n]us for any longer.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]We may be the Phantom Thieves...[n]but this is miserable...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]They probably have a pretty[n]narrow suspect profile by[n]now too.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Hey, don't scare us like that![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]It's OK though. They[n]don't have any evidence.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Yes, I expect they're frantically[n]searching for some as we speak.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_023_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]No way they're gonna[n]find anything though.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_024_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]It's only a matter of time.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_025_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]We have to hurry and do[n]something about this...[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 5 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 1 0 0]...E-Everything's going to be fine.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 2 0 0]Unless they know about the Metaverse,[n]there's no way they'll get any info on us.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
