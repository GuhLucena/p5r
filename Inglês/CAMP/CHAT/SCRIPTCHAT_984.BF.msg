[s][f 5 14]It's... certainly evocative.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Well, don't let it get to you.[n]Shit happens.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]It's understandable, given the[n]heat. Perhaps your hands grew[n]sweaty and it slipped.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Next time we'll make sure we go[n]somewhere we can actually eat.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Agreed. I'd prefer an indoor[n]establishment, myself.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Preferably one with ample[n]seating and free refills on water.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Uh... that'd just be the diner[n]again.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]And why not? It's a place of calm[n]where one may also partake of[n]delicious food.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I mean, I guess...? Man, all this[n]talk about food's got me hungry.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]A cup ramen would hit the spot.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]I believe I shall do the same.[n]Fortunately, I recently acquired[n]some high-quality bread crusts.[n][w][e]
