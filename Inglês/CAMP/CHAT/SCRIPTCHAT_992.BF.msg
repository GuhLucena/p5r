[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]Sorry for messaging you so late.[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]That takes me back.[e]
[s]I forgot about that.[e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]I know. It's already been two[n]months...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]Well, it's already March. I can't[n]blame you.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]I've got a lot of mixed feelings[n]about this picture, I guess.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]That's supposed to be me there.[n]But it just... isn't.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]It really makes me realize how[n]buried I was in Kasumi's identity.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_011_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]But you've changed now.[e]
[s]Now you're Sumire.[e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]Right! I'm not going to[n]run away anymore.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]That's right. I'm not going to[n]run away anymore.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 19]Actually, there's one more photo[n]I want you to see.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 18 521 25 2][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]It's kind of embarrassing, but this[n]is a photo my coach took of me.[n]The real me, I guess.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]Training is tough, and it's really[n]hard sometimes, but...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]I feel like I'm finally moving[n]forward with my life.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_019_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]You've grown.[e]
[s]I'll support you.[e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]It's all thanks to you, Senpai.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]When you tell me these things,[n]I feel like I could take on the[n]whole world.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]I'll make our dream come true.[n]And I'll do it as myself—not as[n]Kasumi.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_023_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]I'll climb all the way to the top[n]of the gymnastics world.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_024_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]So... could you keep watching[n]over me until then?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_025_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Of course.[e]
[s]We're a team.[e]

[msg MSG_026_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]Oh gosh... I'm tearing up[n]for some reason...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_027_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]Falling apart at the slightest thing...[n]I guess that means I really am back[n]to being Sumire, huh...?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_028_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]Oh—my break's over. I have to[n]get back to training...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_029_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Talk to you later![n][w][e]
