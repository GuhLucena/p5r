[s][f 5 14]We got a new post about that old[n]man who was stirring up trouble[n]in Kichijoji![n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Sounds like he and his son went[n]around apologizing to everyone in[n]Harmony Alley.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It was like he was a totally different[n]person. Begging them on his knees[n]for forgiveness, and all...[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]Sounds like a change of heart.[e]

[s]You sure it WAS him?[e]
