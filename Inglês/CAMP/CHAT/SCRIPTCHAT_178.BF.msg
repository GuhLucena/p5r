[s][f 5 14]Shido spilled the beans at[n]that conference, right?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Why isn't it making any news?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Is it because he's a politician?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]I have no doubt that political[n]connections are involved.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]But that theoretically shouldn't[n]have an impact on the news...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]What about all the people who saw[n]him on TV? They HAD to see that![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Everyone should've heard him[n]say all that heavy stuff, right?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Right.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]What happened can't be kept[n]secret. It'll be apparent soon.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Makoto's sister is[n]working on a case too![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I'm sure we'll see the results of[n]that if we just wait patiently.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Let's assume so. More importantly,[n]we have exams coming up...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]I think they may have[n]come at a good time.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]We've really gone through a lot[n]lately. Everyone must be tired.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]It certainly was a[n]good deal of trouble...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Uh, exams are more tiring than[n]any shit we've been doing...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Good luck, you guys![n][w][e]
