[s][f 5 14]I saw the conference![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]But something's not right. It's[n]like nobody's reacting to it...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]There hasn't been any kind of[n]movement on the forum either.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Even the people on TV are[n]just talking about the election...[n]Nothing about the Phantom Thieves.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Isn't that kinda weird?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_005_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]It bothers me.[e]
[s]You think?[e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah. It doesn't make[n]any sense, right?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Support for the Phantom Thieves[n]didn't even increase after they[n]made their announcement...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah. It doesn't make any sense![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Support for the Phantom Thieves[n]didn't even increase after they[n]made their announcement...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Anyway, maybe I'll try[n]changing the poll question.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]It'd be odd asking people if[n]they support the Phantom Thieves[n]now that so much has changed.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]All right, I'll find out what[n]people really think! Just wait![n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 3 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 20 0 0]...I don't really get it. What's he[n]going to ask?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 21 0 0]Well, let's leave the popularity[n]stuff to Mishima for now.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
