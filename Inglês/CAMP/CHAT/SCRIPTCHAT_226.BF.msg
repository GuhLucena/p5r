[s][f 5 14]You did it![n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]You took care of that teacher,[n]right? The one that was picking on[n]her junior?[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It seems like she's less of a bully[n]now. She's starting to act like[n]a proper mentor.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I'm just glad it didn't escalate to[n]the level that Kamoshida took it.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]When things are bad between the[n]teachers, it's always the students[n]who get caught in the crossfire.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Kinda makes you wonder what[n]would've happened to Shujin[n]without the Phantom Thieves.[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]The school would crumble.[e]
[s]Probably nothing.[e]
[s]They'd be better off.[e]

[msg MSG_032_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah. I know I would've had it[n]rough, at least. The Phantom[n]Thieves saved me.[n][w][e]

[s][f 5 14]You think so? Well, no matter[n]what the public thinks, I'll[n]always support them![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_034_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Don't say that! I'll always support[n]them, no matter what people say![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_035_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]For now, at least, we've brought[n]some peace back to the school.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Let's keep up the good work![n][w][e]
