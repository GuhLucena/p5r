[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Ryuji's like that all[n]year round though.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Yup, he's the same as always.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]You guys, we're in the[n]middle of class![n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Our third semester is almost[n]over, so at least try to[n]pay attention for now.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Hahaha. Mako-chan is the[n]same as always too.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Oh, I know! It's been far too[n]long since our last meetup. How[n]about we get together tomorrow?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Count me in! Whaddya[n]think, [f 4 2]?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_07_00 top]
[s][f 5 14]Of course.[e]
[s]Either way's fine.[e]
[s]I'm too sleepy.[e]

[msg MSG_008_0_1 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]It's settled then. Want[n]to meet up at Leblanc?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_2 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Sounds like a plan to me![n]Let's meet at Leblanc![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_3 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]You too, [f 4 2]...?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_4 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Anyways, he can get over that.[n]Let's meet up at Leblanc![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]We should head over there[n]separately, just to be safe.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]That would be wise. We don't[n]want the police to suspect[n]anything of us.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Though it's likely OK considering[n]how long we've been laying low.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Roger roger. I'll tell Sojiro[n]that everyone's gonna show up.[n][w][e]
