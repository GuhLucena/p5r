[s][f 5 14]Attention, all ye jetlagged.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Someone from Shujin came to[n]Leblanc yesterday.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]What? Who?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_1 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Uh, he had messy hair[n]and glasses...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_2 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I dunno. Just sounds like[n][f 4 2] to me.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 3 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 0 65535 65535 0]...Oh, that's right. Maruki did stop by.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[sel SEL_005_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]The counselor?[e]
[s]Was his name Maruki?[e]

[msg MSG_006_0_01 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]You mean Dr. Maruki?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_02 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]I think so. Dr. Maruki, the counselor.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_3 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]I think so. Dr. Maruki, the counselor.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]He said he was studying[n]cognitive psience.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]He's in that field too?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]...You don't think he's connected[n]to the incident with Futaba's[n]mother...?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Oh, no. I didn't get that vibe[n]from him.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]He seemed actually interested in[n]cognitive psience. It wasn't like[n]he was just using it.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]You two got talking, then?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]A little. He seemed nice.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]For a stranger to connect with[n]Futaba is no easy feat. He must[n]have quite a talent for this.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I'm not sure "talent" is the word[n]for it, but yeah, he's cool.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]What, you wanna get him to[n]counsel you too?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]I see no point in having my heart[n]probed by an utter stranger.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Truth, man.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Still, I am curious as to how he[n]managed to negate Futaba's[n]usual reticence.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]I dunno. We just talked normally.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]But he's such a good listener, right?[n]Maybe you ended up talking more[n]than usual.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]So it's true! He does have some[n]extraordinary effect![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_023_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Surely he must have some greater[n]insight, the better to espy the[n]innermost truths of the heart![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_024_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Holy shit, this dude has ESP!?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_025_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]"Espy." To see or perceive.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_026_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Makotoâ€”is there any way you[n]could arrange for me to meet him?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_027_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]What? Me? You want to[n]meet him that badly?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_028_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Please. I feel there is something[n]here I must confirm for myself.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_029_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Well, I can't make anything[n]happen instantly, but... I'll see[n]what I can do.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_030_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]My sincerest thanks. I'm looking[n]forward to finally meeting him.[n][w][e]
