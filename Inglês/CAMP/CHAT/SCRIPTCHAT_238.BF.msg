[s][f 5 14]We did it! We saved the city![n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]You know that small-time mobster[n]in Shibuya? Sounds like he's[n]quitting the criminal life.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Sheesh. I wish they'd just[n]leave us alone.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]First Kaneshiro, now these guys.[n]Hopefully this'll be the last time[n]anyone tries this.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_030_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]I think so.[e]
[s]Who can say?[e]
[s]Evil never sleeps.[e]

[msg MSG_031_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, that'd be nice.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_032_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Maybe one day we'll be able to[n]get rid of ALL criminals, huh?[n]I wish.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_033_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]But as long as evil exists, the[n]Phantom Thieves will never rest,[n]right?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_034_0_0 [Mishima]]
[s][f 5 14]Man, the Phantom Thieves sure[n]are heroes in Shibuya though.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I think they've become more[n]reliable than the police.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]I'll be counting on you again[n]if I find another case![n][w][e]
