[s][f 5 14]Y'know, I've been curious...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]What's Kosei like? Is it[n]filled with guys like Yusuke?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I imagine there are a lot of...[n]"different" people there.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Now that you mention it, I have[n]one very interesting classmate.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]She is a female shogi player,[n]and seemingly quite the[n]skilled one at that.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Are you talking about Hifumi[n]Togo? I remember hearing she's[n]a student at Kosei.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]They say she's the most beautiful[n]shogi player around right now.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Dude, that sounds too good to[n]be true! Gimme some more info![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]I do not know much about her.[n]She is not the kind of person[n]to let others close to her.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]It sounds like she only focuses[n]on her shogi pursuits. After all,[n]it's said she is a lone genius...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]However, I have heard she is[n]commonly seen at the church[n]over in Kanda.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]For real!? We gotta go![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]You'll probably get struck down[n]by a bolt of lightning if you're[n]going for that ulterior motive.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]That ain't it! This is for[n]the Phantom Thieves![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I mean, shogi's a kinda battle,[n]right? She's gotta know all sorts[n]of insane strategies and stuff![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Uh...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]That is quite the stretch.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Churches are supposed to be[n]holy. Don't do this, Ryuji.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Urgh, you guys're gonna pay[n]for this one day![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14][f 4 2], you go spy[n]on her for me![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Find out if she's really[n]as cute as they say she is.[n][f 5 15][w][e]

[msg MSG_999_0_0 [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 1 0 0]*sigh* Let's ignore that idiot. Anyway,[n]a shogi expert, huh?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 2 0 0]Striking an enemy with but a moment's[n]inspiration, skillfully strategizing toward[n]victory...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 3 0 0]Those might actually be good tactics[n]to know for our work as the Phantom[n]Thieves.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 4 0 0]They said she's at the church in Kanda,[n]right? We should check it out when you[n]have the time.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_SPOT_OPEN_KANDA]
[s]You can now go to [clr 1]Kanda[clr 27].[n][w][e]
