[msg MSG_000_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]So, about the investigation...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]It seems they have no evidence[n]that can truly be called as such.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Well duh.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]However, it seems they[n]have no intentions of[n]changing their plans.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]They're going to investigate[n]at both Shujin Academy and[n]Leblanc, right?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Indeed.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Hm. I can understand Shujin...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]But why Leblanc?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]The key is Wakaba Isshiki.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Is it cause of my mom's research?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Correct.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Her study of cognitive[n]psience is closely connected[n]to this case.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Of that, there can be no doubt.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Then this guy's really the[n]mastermind behind all of this?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]That would be the case.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]There can be no mistake...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]The one who erased cognitive[n]psience from this world is surely[n]the culprit behind everything.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]And getting rid of the[n]research was to ensure only[n]they could use its powers?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]How perceptive of you. Yes, that[n]is the only logical conclusion.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Both Sae-san and I were searching[n]for clues about that research.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]But just as we were about to[n]deepen our investigation,[n]this commotion began.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]And to make things even[n]more troublesome...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]There was only one person[n]with strong connections to both[n]Shujin Academy and Leblanc.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_023_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]And that person turned out to be[n]the leader of the Phantom Thieves.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_024_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]So the culprit had calculated[n]all of this in advance?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_025_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Heavens no.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_026_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]That would be impossible.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_027_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]This was a miracle created by[n]the coinciding of multiple[n]chance situations.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_028_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Dude, you hear that? He says you[n]got miraculously bad luck. Don't[n]that make you feel good?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_029_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]I'm so lucky.[e]
[s]That's not funny.[e]

[msg MSG_030_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Y'know, shitty luck[n]is still luck.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_031_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]C'mon, you gotta be able to[n]laugh it off at this point.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_032_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]Yes, your luck really[n]is impressive.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_033_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]At any rate, that's the[n]current state of things.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_034_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]And that's why we must obstruct[n]the investigation at all costs.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_035_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Yes, that's our intention.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CHAT_MORUEND_00 [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 5 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 1 0 0]You really do have something special[n]about you. I can say that with[n]confidence now.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
