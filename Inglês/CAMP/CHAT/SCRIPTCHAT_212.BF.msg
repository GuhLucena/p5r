[s][f 5 14]How'd it go, people?[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]This guy does stuff like vandalize[n]illegally-parked cars, or drop-kick[n]smokers in no-smoking areas...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I kinda see why they say this[n]AI Maask guy is outta control.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Plenty of people aren't happy with[n]his antics, but he does seem to[n]have quite a following.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It seems he has a strange sort of[n]charisma, despite everything.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I asked around too, but I didn't[n]learn much... Sorry.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Did you figure anything out,[n][f 4 2]?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_003_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]His last name is Amasaki.[e]
[s]His screenname's an anagram.[e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Nice! Anything else?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Huh, okay. Anything else?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_006_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]His full name's in his handle.[e]
[s]His handle's based on his name.[e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]I see. So if we can unscramble the[n]anagram, we'll have his full name.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_008_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]His last name is Amasaki.[e]
[s]Amasaki's his brother's surname.[e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Then all that remains is to[n]unscramble the whole thing.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]So if he's A.I. Maask Ouzi... and[n]his last name's Amasaki...[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_011_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]That just leaves "Ouzi."[e]
[s]Maybe read it backwards...?[e]
[s]I give up.[e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]...Yes, you're right! Well done,[n][f 4 2].[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Wait... Oh yeah, so the AI Maask[n]part is just Amasaki![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Backwards? Dude, you expect me to[n]believe his name's Izuo Ksaamia?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]I think I just figured it out.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Same here.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]I think I've figured it out.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]For real!?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]He's separated his first and last[n]names into discrete parts.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]AI Maask comes out neatly to[n]Amasaki. That also explains the[n]extra "a" in the word.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]And Ouzi on its own can be read[n]backwards to find the name[n]"Izuo."[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Which means our target's name[n]is most likely Izuo Amasaki.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Just checked the Nav. We got[n]a hit![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_023_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]That's our advisor! Freaking[n]awesome![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_024_0_0 [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1181 65535 0]That settles it! Now we know his full name![n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 1 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 65535 0]All that's left is to meet at the hideout[n]and talk it over with everyone.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
