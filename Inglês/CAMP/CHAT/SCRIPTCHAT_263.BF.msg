[s][f 5 14]This request isn't from the Phan-[n]Site. I'd like to submit it as a[n]personal favor.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It concerns a girl in the same art[n]track as me, with some renown as[n]a high-school doujin artist.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Her recent doujinshi and certain[n]posts online have raised suspicions[n]that her work may be plagiarized.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_001_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Plagiarized?[e]
[s]"Doujinshi"?[e]
[s]Is she making bank?[e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]For my part, I've seen some clear[n]evidence of that in my research.[n]I suspect her myself.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Oh—as I understand it, it's a manga[n]one creates and publishes wholly[n]independently.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Based on my own research online,[n]I've begun to suspect her as well.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Inasmuch as a high schooler can,[n]I suppose, yes.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Based on my own research online,[n]I've begun to suspect her as well.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]She's denied the allegations on[n]social media, which only caused[n]further uproar and backlash.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Since then, she's closed her[n]account and withdrawn from[n]public view.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_006_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Are you friends with her?[e]
[s]How is she at school?[e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]She's mostly devoted to the manga[n]club, but I personally came to[n]know her through the art club.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Despite our differences, she's a[n]fellow artist making her way in the[n]world. That's worth respecting.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Traditional Japanese painting may[n]be a far cry from manga, but she's[n]still a great talent—and a friend.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I don't know her situation, but if[n]she truly is plagiarizing, perhaps[n]we could change her heart?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_008_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Of course.[e]
[s]I'll consider it.[e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]I appreciate it. Though... I would[n]rather solve this nonviolently,[n]if possible.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I called her my friend earlier,[n]and... I'd like to hope I can still[n]act as one.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_010_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Got it.[e]
[s]I'll look into it.[e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]My thanks. She styles herself as[n]"CHIYO" online, but her true[n]name is Chiyo Tsumano.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I will try and gather more[n]information at Kosei.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]I will leave the investigation of[n]Akihabara to you. Reportedly,[n]she sold her doujinshi there.[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Well, we can't ignore this. I guess we'll[n]go to Akihabara and ask around.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s]When investigating requests, you may find that[n]you can change a target's heart nonviolently by[n]speaking up mid-battle.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s]For this to succeed, you will need to gather[n]information in the real world.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s]Speak to the townspeople and collect information[n]that will aid in changing the target's heart.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
