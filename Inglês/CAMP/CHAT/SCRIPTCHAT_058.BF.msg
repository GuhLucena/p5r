[s][f 5 14]A criminal who uses the Metaverse[n]to carry out their crimes...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]This is no longer a[n]matter we can ignore.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Especially cause they might be[n]the one who killed Futaba's mom.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]To be honest, I had considered the[n]idea that they might be behind only[n]the rumored psychotic breakdowns...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]But now it appears as though this[n]person is killing people as well.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Technically, they're making people[n]have mental shutdowns, which then[n]cause them to die.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]That's what happens when you[n]kill someone's Shadow, yeah?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Mm-hm. We were worried about[n]it back with Kamoshida and[n]Madarame, remember?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Psychotic breakdowns and mental[n]shutdowns... It would make sense if[n]the same person was behind them.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]The news never talks about[n]the victims dying, so people[n]only know about the breakdowns.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]So this shit's seriously a case![n]If that's for real, whoever's[n]doing it is some kinda assassin![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]I'm gonna beat the[n]crap outta them...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]I would suggest we be more[n]cautious going forward as well.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]We still don't know much,[n]even about our Metaverse Nav.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]That is true.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I wonder why that thing exists...[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_017_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]There was a man in my dream...[e]
[s]I don't know.[e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]A dream? You still half[n]asleep, dude?[n][w][e]

[msg MND_019_0_0]
[s]It would still be difficult[n]for me to explain about Igor...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I wonder if that criminal[n]is using the app too...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]Futaba, this seems like[n]your area of expertise. Do[n]you know anything about it?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]No, I'd never even heard of[n]it before. I mean, it's not[n]really even an app.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_023_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]It's more like... a mysterious[n]app-like thing.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_024_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]I see...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_025_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]It's OK though.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_026_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]I might not know much about the[n]Nav, but I can still navigate you[n]guys on the path to victory![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_027_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]I'll guide you to whatever[n]criminal you're looking for.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_028_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Mwehehe... You can rely on me![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_029_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Awesome, dude! You're way[n]more reliable than Mona![n][w][e]
