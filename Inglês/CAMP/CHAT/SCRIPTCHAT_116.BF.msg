[s][f 5 14]I'm not sure why, but I feel[n]restless for some reason...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]We managed to steal Shido's[n]heart, but the reactions have[n]been... less than ideal.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Yes, it has been quite[n]difficult to relax.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]I wonder if people will be[n]disappointed to find out what[n]his true nature really is.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]It might be more than just[n]plain old disappointment.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Either way, it's better that than[n]let him keep deceiving people![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]But even if his true nature[n]becomes widely known...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Makoto]]

[s]Who knows.[e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]There really aren't many great[n]politicians running, but anyone[n]would be better than Shido![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Worrying about it will not[n]help matters though.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Anyways, let's wait for him to[n]have the change of heart. We[n]can talk more after that.[n][w][e]
