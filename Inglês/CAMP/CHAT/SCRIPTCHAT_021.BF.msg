[s][f 5 14]Hey, don't you think the[n]atmosphere at school's[n]kinda different now?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_001_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]You mean with there being[n]no Kamoshida?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Yeah, nobody ever talked[n]about him out in the open[n]like this before.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_003_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]That's true.[e]
[s]You're imagining things.[e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I wish someone'd just thank[n]us for it or something...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Naw man, things're totally[n]different now, and it's all[n]thanks to us.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Either way, everything has[n]worked out for the best.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]After all, Kamoshida's actually[n]been punished for his crimes.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]That's victory enough for me.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_009_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]I agree.[e]
[s]Are you sure?[e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Actually, it's more than[n]enough. It's incredible.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I wonder what's gonna[n]happen to him now.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I mean, he's a famous criminal[n]at this point, right?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]He's gonna have to deal with[n]people hating him forever...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]That might be true, but I don't[n]have any sympathy for him.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]He got what he deserved.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]For sure.[n][w][e]
