[s][f 5 14]Hello, Phantom Thieves.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]How goes the investigation in[n]the false accusation case?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_001_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]Piece of cake.[e]
[s][f 5 14]We got some intel.[e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]The fellow in question is one[n]Toji Karataki. Like me, he's a[n]second-year at Kosei High.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Oh? Anything else?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]After his parents split in a divorce[n]while he was still young, his[n]mother committed suicide.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]It sounds like life hasn't really[n]been kind to him...[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]He's been working a job at the[n]same time as going to school,[n]and even maintaining his grades.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]I... see.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Impressive indeed, that you could[n]deduce so much with so few clues.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]But then again, you are the famed[n]Phantom Thieves, aren't you? I was[n]right to ask you for help.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]How about on your end?[n]You dig anything up?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Of course.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]Well... rudimentary pieces, at least.[n]I'll have to ask a little more[n]patience.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I'd like to doublecheck the facts[n]before I share them with you all.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Now, if you'll excuse me, I have[n]some investigating to do.[n][w][e]
[s][f 5 14]I will let you all know once[n]I'm ready.[n][f 5 15][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]Heheh... Looks like we're ahead of the[n]game when it comes to getting intel.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0]Either way, I guess we'll have to wait until[n]Akechi's done with his investigation.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
