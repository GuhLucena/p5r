[s][f 5 14]Dude, something is WRONG[n]with Ushimaru.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]What do you mean?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I dunno, something's up! I guess[n]it's not wrong, but he's all[n]different![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Anyone know what he's saying?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Ushimaru who?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_006_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]A strict teacher.[e]
[s]Our Social Studies teacher.[e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]He's a chalk-throwing marksman.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]Ah. Say no more.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]He's awfully strict, isn't he? Even[n]the freshman have heard stories.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]What exactly is different?[n]His personality?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]What, he's super nice now?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]That's just it! He's so nice,[n]it's creepy![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]And no matter who I ask, they tell[n]me he's always been like this![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]We got people saying he's[n]basically the school's own[n]Buddha![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]It does sound as if he's been[n]enlightened, I suppose...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Haru]]
[s][f 5 14]So Dr. Maruki has changed[n]someone's personality?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14]If he really wanted to change,[n]then yes, it's possible...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_017_0_1 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]What!? Ushimaru, of all people!?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Sumire]]
[s][f 5 14]It's like how I wished to[n]be Kasumi...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]It's like your own situations, most[n]probably. Something in his past[n]must have been overwritten.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_019_0_1 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]It's also possible his personality[n]just changed, independent of any[n]external events.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]You figure the real Ushimaru went[n]through something bad?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Maybe he was so nice to everyone,[n]the students took advantage of him[n]and went full delinquent?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Ann]]
[s][f 5 14]Ugh. That WOULD be traumatic.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_022_0_1 [Akechi]]
[s][f 5 14]Well, we can speculate all we like.[n]He's the only one who could say[n]for sure what's changed.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_022_0_2 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]It's still difficult to understand...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_023_0_0 [Yusuke]]
[s][f 5 14]So if it would serve their happiness,[n]even one's personality can change...[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_024_0_0 top]
[s][f 5 14]That's not Ushimaru.[e]
[s]I bet he's happy now.[e]
[s]Like a change of heart.[e]

[msg MSG_025_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Exactly.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_026_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]It's not like I liked him in the first[n]place, but this is freaking weird.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_027_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Well, yeah, but still...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_028_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]Something's just not right here.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_029_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I guess, though it's not like[n]Ushimaru was full-on evil.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_030_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][f 5 14]I'm gettin' so mad, I'm gonna[n]go to sleep.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_031_0_0 [Futaba]]
[s][f 5 14]Is that even a thing people do[n]when they're mad?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_032_0_0 [Makoto]]
[s][f 5 14][f 5 15]Honestly... You could always just[n]pay attention in class.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_033_0_0 [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 2 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 1 1027 65535 0]That Ushimaru, huh? It's hard to believe.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 0 0 0 65535 0]Guess we'll just have to check it out[n]when we're in his class.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
