[s][bup 0 3 1 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]Well, I can't type that well, but I can[n]at least scroll up and down.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 2 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]That aside, there was a post that caught[n]my eye.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 2 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]Yeah, I found something.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 5 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]I knew you were gonna say that![n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]Look, would you quit joking for a second[n]and listen!? There was a forum post[n]that caught my eye.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 2 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]A lot of cats have been going missing in[n]Yongen. The owners are apparently[n]worried they've been kidnapped.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[sel SEL_006_0_0 top]
[s]Who did it?[e]
[s]Do we have a name?[e]

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 2 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]The main suspect seems to be this office[n]worker named "Neko Nora." People have[n]heard meowing coming from her place.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]She's got a history with catnapping, too.[n]Apparently the police even had to get[n]involved.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]But it's not that simple. I was worried[n]about the cats, so I went to take a peek[n]into the target's room.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]But the cats were all eating classy gourmet[n]cat food! And she was just watching with[n]this gentle, happy look on her face...[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[sel SEL_008_0_0 top]
[s]What's going on?[e]
[s]Weird...[e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 3 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]We need to find out what her motive is.[n]From what I saw, I honestly don't think[n]she's a bad person at heart.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]How about we get more information on[n]her, and then go to Mementos?[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][vp 8 2 65535 0 0 0]I'd rather not use force to change her[n]heart if we can avoid it. Maybe we can[n]just persuade her.[n][f 1 3 65535][w][e]

[msg SYS_010_0_0]
[s]When investigating requests, you may[n]find that you can change a target's heart[n]nonviolently by speaking up mid-battle.[n][w][e]
[s]For this to succeed, you will need to[n]gather information in the real world.[n][w][e]
[s]Speak to the townspeople and collect[n]information that will aid in changing[n]the target's heart.[n][w][e]

[msg HELP_MEMENTOS_MISSION_04 [Request Received!]]
[s][clr 4]Target Intel Gained[clr 27][n]You can now send a calling card from[n]the [clr 2]hideout[clr 27]. Sometimes you will gain[n]intel from your [clr 3]teammates[clr 27] like this.[n][w][e]
