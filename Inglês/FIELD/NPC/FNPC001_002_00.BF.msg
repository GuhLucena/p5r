[s][vp 8 2 1 0 65535 0]You look displeased.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 1 0 65535 0]I always find someone in the city with[n]that expression, drifting along in a sea[n]of happy people.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 1 0 65535 0]But what are you all so concerned about?[n][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 1 0 65535 0]It'd be so much better if you just forgot[n]all the bad stuff and lived like me...[n][w][e]

[s][vp 8 2 1 0 65535 0]It's the season for partings, huh... I do[n]feel a bit sad about leaving this place.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_HOMELESS_DAY_021_0_0 top]
[s]Where are you going?[e]
[s]Let's meet again.[e]

[msg MSG_HOMELESS_DAY_021_1_0 [Homeless Man]]
[s][vp 8 2 1 0 30 0][f 4 23 1 30 5 10 4 10]I can't atone for my sins if I wallow[n]around, being indecisive. I'll find a[n]job somewhere quiet.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_HOMELESS_DAY_021_2_0 [Homeless Man]]
[s][vp 8 2 1 0 30 0][f 4 23 1 30 5 10 4 10]It's really nice that I actually have[n]someone to say farewell to me...[n]Thank you. It means a lot.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_HOMELESS_DAY_021_3_0 [Homeless Man]]
[s][vp 8 2 1 0 30 0][f 4 23 1 30 5 10 4 10]Considering how foolish of a man I am,[n]I'm not sure if I can atone for my sins...[n][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 1 0 30 0]But I'll live the rest of my life thinking of[n]how I can do that... Farewell, young man.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 1 0 30 0]I hope that someday I'll see you again...[n]If I can manage to become a decent man.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_Q83_HINT_HOMELESS_00 [Homeless Man]]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Hm? Did you need something?[n][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]A fixed match that's linked to sports[n]gambling? Yeah... I've heard about it.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 1 0 65535 0]They're apparently ran by a dangerous[n]organization that often deals with[n]foreign mafia groups.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]And I hear that they make cruel threats[n]to the players, especially female ones.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_Q83_HINT_HOMELESS_01 top]
[s]For example?[e]
[s]Threats?[e]

[msg MSG_Q83_HINT_HOMELESS_02 [Homeless Man]]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Like death threats if they lose, though[n]I doubt that they'll actually kill them.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Well since it's a fixed match deal, they[n]can't go to the police. They have to go[n]by their own rules instead.[n][w][e]
