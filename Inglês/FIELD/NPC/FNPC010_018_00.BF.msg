[msg quest27_hint_talk_00 [Angry Gamer]]
[s][f 4 23 1 614 3 10 0 10]What? You wanna play this?[n][w][e]
[s]I'm playing Gun About right now, so[n]don't bother me.[n][w][e]

[msg quest27_hint_talk_01 [Angry Gamer]]

[msg quest27_hint_talk_02 [Flustered Gamer]]

[s]The cheater?[e]

[msg quest27_hint_talk_05 [Angry Gamer]]
[s][f 4 23 1 614 3 10 0 10]Sorry, but I'm not gonna be off this[n]machine for a while.[n][w][e]
[s]Hold on. You like Gun About, but you[n]don't know about the cheater?[n][w][e]

[msg quest27_hint_talk_06 [Flustered Gamer]]
[s][f 4 23 1 613 3 10 0 10]Th-There's a famous cheater that people[n]have been complaining about online.[n][w][e]
[s]He doesn't take any damage, no matter[n]how much you attack him. No one's[n]ever beat him.[n][w][e]
[s]The developers shut down his account,[n]but he just keeps making new ones and[n]doing the same thing.[n][w][e]

[msg quest27_hint_talk_07 [Angry Gamer]]
[s][f 4 23 1 614 3 10 0 10]Some people online found his real name[n]on a social media site, and now they're[n]all raging.[n][w][e]
[s]I think his real name is [clr 2]Yoshikuni Nejima[clr 27].[n]That dirtbag is 40 years old and jobless.[n][w][e]
[s]Well, I'm gonna crush Nejima and be[n]a hero.[n][w][e]

[msg quest27_hint_talk_08 [Flustered Gamer]]

[msg MSG_quest27_morgana_10 [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 25 1 65535 0 0]So that's the malevolent player that[n]Mishima was talking about... He's the[n]infamous cheater.[n][w][e]
[s][f 4 25 1 65535 0 0]It's one thing to cheat if you're playing[n]alone, but it's wrong to mess with other[n]people like that.[n][w][e]
[s][f 4 25 1 65535 0 0]We got his name, too. It looks like[n][clr 2]Yoshikuni Nejima[clr 27] is going to be our[n]next target.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_quest27_Target_Find]
[s]Now that you have your target, you need to[n]make sure everyone's on board with the mission.[n]Summon them to the hideout for a vote.[n][w][e]

[msg quest27_hint_talk_11 [Angry Gamer]]
[s][f 4 23 1 614 3 10 0 10]Hurry up and get me some more coins[n]before that cheating bastard Nejima[n]logs out![n][w][e]

[msg quest27_hint_talk_12 [Flustered Gamer]]

[msg quest27_hint_talk_20 [Angry Gamer]]
[s][f 4 23 1 614 3 10 0 10]Hey... We've met before, haven't we?[n][w][e]
[s]That makes us friends, right? You think[n]you can lend me some money!?[n][w][e]

[msg quest27_hint_talk_21 [Flustered Gamer]]
[s][f 4 23 1 613 3 10 0 10]Hey, you can't just ask random people[n]for money![n][w][e]
[s]Give it up already. You already spent[n]all your money trying to beat Nejima.[n][w][e]

[msg quest27_hint_talk_22 [Angry Gamer]]
[s][f 4 23 1 614 3 10 0 10]Tch. Fine. So, what do you want?[n][w][e]

[sel SELquest27_hint_talk_23 top]
[s]Do you know about King?[e]
[s]Are you King?[e]

[msg quest27_hint_talk_24 [Angry Gamer]]
[s][f 4 23 1 614 3 10 0 10]King? Of course I know about him.[n][w][e]

[msg quest27_hint_talk_25 [Angry Gamer]]
[s][f 4 23 1 614 3 10 0 10]Am I King? No way.[n][w][e]

[msg quest27_hint_talk_26 [Flustered Gamer]]
[s][f 4 23 1 613 3 10 0 10]You're talking about the King of[n]Akihabara, right?[n][w][e]
[s]He's just in elementary school, but he's[n]a real pro at playing Gun About.[n][w][e]

[msg quest27_hint_talk_27 [Angry Gamer]]
[s][f 4 23 1 614 3 10 0 10]That damn grade schooler... He has to[n]be a cheater too.[n][w][e]

[msg quest27_hint_talk_28 [Flustered Gamer]]
[s][f 4 23 1 613 3 10 0 10]I hear that he usually plays at the[n]Gigolo Arcade in Akiba.[n][w][e]
[s]He's actually really good at Gun About.[n]People can tell from the way he moves.[n][w][e]
[s]You might be able to find him during[n]the day. Elementary kids can't get into[n]arcades at night.[n][w][e]

[msg quest27_hint_talk_29 [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 25 1 65535 0 0]So he might be at the Gigolo Arcade[n]in Akihabara, eh? Let's head there and[n]see this King.[n][w][e]

[msg quest27_hint_talk_30 [Flustered Gamer]]
[s][f 4 23 1 613 3 10 0 10]I think King might be at the Gigolo[n]Arcade in Akiba.[n][w][e]

[msg quest27_hint_talk_31 [Angry Gamer]]
[s][f 4 23 1 614 3 10 0 10]Calling himself King, even though[n]he's just an elementary school kid...[n]He's gotta be cheating.[n][w][e]

[s][vp 8 2 1 0 780 0]...Never thought I'd get this far playing[n]legit. Maybe I didn't need the cheats[n]after all...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_TAKEKUMA_002_0_0]
