[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Man, I saw someone real pretty[n]around here! She was like a model![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_065_0_0 [Energetic First-Year]]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Do you mean Takamaki-senpai? She's[n]famous. I heard she used to live[n]abroad and even models for ads...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_066_0_0 [Motivated First-Year]]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]I wish I could get to know her, but she[n]seems almost impossible to approach.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_067_0_0 [Energetic First-Year]]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Agreed. She totally stands out too.[n]Apparently some third-years have[n]to keep an eye on her.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_068_0_0 [Motivated First-Year]]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]What!? How scary... I guess that's[n]what happens if you stand out as[n]much as she does...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_026_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Finally found you. I got a favor to ask.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_027_0_0 [Agitated Volleyball Player]]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]S-Sakamoto... I knew you'd show up[n]for me...[n][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Look, I have to go cheer for[n]Mr. Kamoshida, so it'd be[n]great if this could wait till later.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_028_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]He's the one that gave you those injuries,[n]right? We wanna accuse him, so we need[n]victims.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Do you really wanna let that bastard run[n]free? I'm beggin' you to help us out![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_030_0_0 [Agitated Volleyball Player]]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]...Sorry, but you'll have to look for[n]someone else.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]I want to graduate without any issues...[n]I'd rather not end up like you.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]If I get on Mr. Kamoshida's bad side,[n]I won't get away. You know how[n]influential he is, right...?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_031_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Dammit, his mouth's stayin' shut.[n]All 'cause of that bastard's dirty tricks...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_031_5_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Guess we just gotta move on to[n]the next one. I'm not givin' up...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_078_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]It ain't workin'. Everybody just shuts up[n]the moment we mention Kamoshida's[n]name.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Dammit... What're we supposed to do!?[n][w][e]

[s]Let's rest for a bit.[e]
[s]This is all your fault.[e]

[msg MSG_080_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Yeah, I guess it wouldn't hurt takin'[n]a breather and rethinkin' our strategy[n]for now.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]C'mon, let's go grab something to drink[n]down in the courtyard.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_081_0_0 [Ryuji]]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Don't say that. You're the one[n]with the criminal record...[n][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Er, I mean arrest record. Not criminal.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]...Sorry.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]C'mon, I'll buy you some juice to make up[n]for it. Let's head down to the courtyard.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_032_0_0 [Agitated Volleyball Player]]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Why are you trying to stir up trouble?[n]Everyone is okay with things as they are...[n][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]You should know better than anyone...[n]The status quo is the way to go.[n][w][e]
