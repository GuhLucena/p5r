[s][f 4 23 1 811 3 10 0 10][vp 8 2 1 0 811 0]I heard everyone's happy that all their[n]wishes came true. So that's probably it,[n]right?[n][w][e]

[s][vp 8 2 1 0 810 0]Hmm... But, being too happy might not[n]always be a good thing. You have to be[n]motivated to win a match![n][w][e]

[s]Come on, being happy is a good thing![n][w][e]
