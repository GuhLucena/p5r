[s][f 4 23 1 800 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 800 0]I saw that new transfer student[n]hanging out with Sakamoto-kun.[n]The two of them are so scary...[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 23 1 801 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 801 0]He doesn't look like the kind of[n]guy who'd have a criminal record.[n]Maybe he's one of those?[n][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 1 0 801 0]You know, the people in those[n]accidents. Maybe he suddenly[n]freaks out and attacks people.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_141_307_02 [Scared Female Student]]
[s][f 4 23 1 800 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 800 0]Huh? I don't think so. He's just[n]been coming to school. Actually,[n]he almost seems normal.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 1 0 800 0]And from what I hear, after you[n]have a psychotic breakdown, you[n]go brain dead and die right there.[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 23 1 800 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 800 0]He won't attack anyone in school,[n]will he? Someone told me he hides[n]knives in his clothes...[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 23 1 801 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 801 0]It's probably safer not to get near[n]him. There's already too much[n]strange stuff going on lately.[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 23 1 802 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 802 0]Sakamoto's been asking questions[n]about the volleyball team. Just who[n]does he think he is?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_141_307_06 [Carefree Shujin Student]]
[s][f 4 23 1 803 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 803 0]The volleyball team's never going[n]to tell him anything. They're all[n]completely loyal to Kamoshida.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_141_307_07 [Shujin Student Heading Home]]
[s][f 4 23 1 802 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 802 0]Well, if Kamoshida likes them,[n]their future is pretty much set.[n]Of course they'd back him up.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 1 0 802 0]Speaking of which, I hear[n]Kamoshida's new favorite girl[n]is someone named Suzui.[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 23 1 803 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 803 0]Oh, the girl who was chosen to[n]be a regular? Ah, her face was[n]all swollen. It looked pretty bad.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_141_307_09 [Shujin Student Heading Home]]
[s][f 4 23 1 802 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 802 0]Yeah, that Suzui girl looked really[n]depressed for someone who is so[n]close to a regular spot.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_141_307_10 [Carefree Shujin Student]]
[s][f 4 23 1 803 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 803 0]She's probably just letting all the[n]pressure get to her. Well, we don't[n]really know her, so...[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 23 1 804 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 804 0]Takamaki always looks kind of unhappy[n]whenever Mr. Kamoshida talks to her.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_141_307_12 [Rude Female Student]]
[s][f 4 23 1 805 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 805 0]Maybe she doesn't wanna talk to him at[n]school to show off how she's got him[n]wrapped around her finger? Ugh... Gross.[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 23 1 804 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 804 0]Oh, so that's what's going on... I wonder[n]how far they've gone together...?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_141_307_14 [Gossipy Female Student]]
[s][f 4 23 1 804 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 804 0]Wow, a teacher-student relationship?[n]It'd probably be bad if that got out.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_141_307_15 [Rude Female Student]]
[s][f 4 23 1 805 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 805 0]I bet they'd still work it out if that[n]happened. They wouldn't be together[n]otherwise.[n][w][e]
