[s]I'm the type to bring work home[n]with me, so I also don't get enough[n]sleep a lot of the time.[n][w][e]
[s]Ms. Kawakami might wait till the last[n]minute, but she's never turned in any[n]of her work late.[n][w][e]
[s]I guess you can say she's efficient.[n]She's good at her job, and I think[n]highly of her for it.[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 23 1 802 3 10 0 10]You want to hear about Kawakami?[n][w][e]
[s]She always seems sleepy. Sometimes,[n]she's half-asleep while talking on[n]the phone.[n][w][e]
[s]Oh, almost everyone knows this story[n]about her, but you probably haven't[n]heard it yet...[n][w][e]
[s]Someone saw her half-sleep in the faculty[n]office, cookies in her mouth, mumbling,[n]"I'm lucky!"[n][w][e]
[s]Well, other than that, I haven't really[n]heard much else about her.[n][w][e]
