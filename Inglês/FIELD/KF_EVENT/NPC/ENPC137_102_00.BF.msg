[s][f 4 23 1 853 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 853 0]Oh, be careful. I heard there's a lot of[n]muggings targeting couples lately.[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 23 1 852 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 852 0]Whaâ€”? I should be fine, right?[n]The police will do something about it.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Duck-Faced Student]]
[s][f 4 23 1 853 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 853 0]Yeah. Maybe I'll stop by somewhere fun[n]on the way home, too. I don't care about[n]college exams, anyway.[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 23 1 850 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 850 0]Did you see that second-year[n]on the volleyball team? He took[n]a real massive spike to the face.[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 23 1 851 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 851 0]Oh, Mishima, right? I'm not surprised.[n]He's seriously the slowest person I know.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 1 0 851 0]It's frustrating to watch. He's not getting[n]much better, even with Mr. Kamoshida's[n]coaching.[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 23 1 850 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 850 0]By the way, I hear Kamoshida[n]got an invitation to the national[n]championships? That's amazing.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 1 0 850 0]He's definitely going to be the MVP at[n]our school's volleyball rally tomorrow.[n][w][e]

[msg NIGIYAKAJYOSI_grt_A_01]
[s]Is it true that he murdered[n]someone? Why is he coming[n]to our school?[n][f 1 2 65535][e]

[msg DANSIGUMI_grt_C_01]
[s]He has a criminal record, right?[n]His life's pretty much ruined.[n][f 1 2 65535][e]

[msg JYOSIGUMI_grt_D_01]
[s]Mr. Kamoshida is too good.[n]How is that fair for the other[n]teams?[n][f 1 2 65535][e]

[msg DANSIPEA_grt_E_01]
[s]Hey, look at him...[n]He's such an eyesore.[n]I wish he'd go away already.[n][f 1 2 65535][e]
