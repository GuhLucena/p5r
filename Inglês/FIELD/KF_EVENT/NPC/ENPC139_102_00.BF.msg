[s][f 4 23 1 853 3 10 0 0][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Oh, be careful. I heard there's a lot[n]of muggings targeting couples lately.[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 23 1 852 3 10 0 0][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Whaâ€”? I should be fine, right?[n]The police will do something[n]about it.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Duck-Faced Student]]
[s][f 4 23 1 853 3 10 0 0][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Yeah. Maybe I'll stop by somewhere[n]fun on the way home, too. I don't[n]care about college exams, anyway.[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 23 1 850 3 10 0 0][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Did you see that second-year on the[n]volleyball team? He must've taken a[n]spike in the face.[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 23 1 851 3 10 0 0][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Oh, Mishima, right? He's a real[n]slowpoke, so I'm not surprised.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]It's frustrating to watch. He's not getting[n]much better, even with Mr. Kamoshida's[n]coaching.[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 23 1 850 3 10 0 0][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Oh, I hear Kamoshida was invited by[n]the national championships? That's[n]pretty amazing.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]He's definitely going to be the MVP at[n]our school's volleyball rally tomorrow.[n][w][e]

[msg NIGIYAKAJYOSI_grt_A_01]
[s]Is it true that he[n]murdered someone? Why is[n]he coming to our school?[n][f 1 2 65535][e]

[msg NIGIYAKADANSI_grt_B_01]
[s]The volleyball rally's[n]still going on tomorrow[n]too, right? What a drag.[n][f 1 2 65535][e]

[msg DANSIGUMI_grt_C_01]
[s]He has a criminal[n]record, right? His life's[n]pretty much ruined.[n][f 1 2 65535][e]

[msg JYOSIGUMI_grt_D_01]
[s]Mr. Kamoshida is too[n]good. How is that fair[n]for the other teams?[n][f 1 2 65535][e]

[msg DANSIPEA_grt_E_01]
[s]Hey, look at him...[n]He's such an eyesore.[n]I wish he'd go away already.[n][f 1 2 65535][e]
