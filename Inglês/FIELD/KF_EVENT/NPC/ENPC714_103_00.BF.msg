[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]I think we might be good to go[n]back to Taihei now.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]I think we've already learned all that we[n]possibly could. Let's go see Taihei.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_DET_TSUBAKI_10 top]
[s]I am.[e]
[s]I want to protect her.[e]
[s]I can't say.[e]

[s][bup 0 304 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][f 4 23 1 801 3 10 0 10]Don't worry, I'll keep your secret![n]Besides, students date teachers[n]all the time overseas.[n][w][e]
[s]If you ask me, Ms. Kawakami has[n]a nice face that would look even[n]better with makeup.[n][w][e]
[s]And it's suit her better if she wore her[n]hair up. It'd give off a completely[n]different impression.[n][w][e]
[s]Oh, her clothes also usually hide[n]her body, but I'm sure her legs are[n]really long and pretty.[n][w][e]
[s]I just realized! Maybe she's got[n]a boyfriend! She does go home as[n]fast as she can on the weekends...[n][w][e]
[s]Don't worry though. People steal[n]girlfriends and boyfriends from[n]each other all the time overseas![n][w][e]

[msg MOR_DET_TSUBAKI_12 [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]I don't think we can get any more[n]information out of her.[n][w][e]

[msg MOR_DET_TSUBAKI_14 [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0]Can we actually use anything we might[n]have learned about her looks to try to[n]convince Taihei?[n][w][e]
