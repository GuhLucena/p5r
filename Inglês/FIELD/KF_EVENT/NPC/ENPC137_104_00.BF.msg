[s][f 4 23 1 851 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 851 0]Mr. Kamoshida is going to play again, right?[n]When's his next match?[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_FEMALE_001_00 [Excited Female Student]]
[s][f 4 23 1 850 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 850 0]Let's get there early. I want to see his[n]awesome moves up close.[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 23 1 851 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 851 0]I know, just what you'd expect from a gold[n]medalist! If we cheer for him, maybe he'll[n]even look over at us.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_FEMALE_003_00 [Excited Female Student]]
[s][f 4 23 1 850 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 850 0]I just know he will, and I bet he'll remember[n]our faces, too. Mr. Kamoshida is always nice[n]to girls![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_FEMALE_004_00 [Carefree Female Student]]
[s][f 4 23 1 851 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 851 0]It does seem like he talks to the girls on the[n]volleyball team and that new first-year a lot![n][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 1 0 851 0]I want to get to know an Olympic[n]medalist too![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_FEMALE_100_00 [Carefree Female Student]]
[s][f 4 23 1 851 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 851 0]Oh! I just saw a cat behind the school[n]building. It had black fur and white[n]paws and was so cute![n][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 1 0 851 0]I wanted to pet it, but Sakamoto-kun was[n]hanging around there too... so I ran away.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_FEMALE_101_00 [Excited Female Student]]
[s][f 4 23 1 850 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 850 0]Yeah, it's probably a good idea to stay away[n]from him. You don't know what he'll do.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 1 0 850 0]Now I really want to pet that cat, too. I hope[n]it'll come by the school again tomorrow.[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 23 1 853 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 853 0]There's still time until the next match.[n]This is such a drag.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 1 0 853 0]The people who don't have any matches[n]left are allowed to go home. Maybe I'll[n]just skip out...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_MALE_001_00 [Tired-Looking Student]]
[s][f 4 23 1 852 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 852 0]You're up against Mr. Kamoshida's team[n]next, right? I think everyone would notice[n]if you weren't there.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_MALE_002_00 [Listless-Looking Student]]
[s][f 4 23 1 853 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 853 0]Yeah, I know. I don't want to attract that[n]kind of attention to myself, either.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 1 0 853 0]But even if I do play, I know[n]Mr. Kamoshida'll send some[n]serious spikes my way...[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 23 1 853 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 853 0]Did you hear? That transfer student carries[n]weapons on him.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_MALE_101_00 [Tired-Looking Student]]
[s][f 4 23 1 852 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 852 0]Yeah, I read about that on that underground[n]internet site. He also nearly killed a guy in[n]a fight.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_MALE_102_00 [Listless-Looking Student]]
[s][f 4 23 1 853 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 853 0]Gah... He's a real menace. I hope he doesn't[n]cause more trouble now that college exams[n]are coming up.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_MALE_103_00 [Tired-Looking Student]]
[s][f 4 23 1 852 3 10 0 0][vp 8 2 1 0 852 0]Let's just avoid him. His life's basically[n]ruined, and he probably won't be able[n]to get into college.[n][w][e]

[msg NIGIYAKAJYOSI_grt_A_01]
[s]Hey, it's that transfer student,[n]the one who committed all[n]of those crimes, right?[n][f 1 2 65535][e]

[msg NIGIYAKADANSI_grt_B_01]
[s]Gah, don't come over here![n]He's a real problem, and it's[n]bothering everyone.[n][f 1 2 65535][e]
