[s]Feb. 2[n] [n]Tomorrow is Rumi's birthday. I'll be[n]meeting her parents... My hands have[n]been shaking an awful lot lately.[n] [n]Will they let their daughter marry[n]a low-level researcher like me?[n] [n]Now I'm getting even more anxious...[n][w][e]
[s]When I told Rumi how nervous[n]I'm getting, she just laughed and[n]said I think too much. She may not[n]have understood my problem, but[n]I do so love her laugh.[n] [n]I don't think I'll be able to sleep with[n]my nerves like this, but I need to lie[n]down anyway.[n][w][e]
[s]I've been getting the worst headaches[n]lately... I might be pushing myself[n]too hard for this thesis.[n] [n]I just really want to be in top form[n]tomorrow. I know this diary was[n]originally just for research notes,[n]but now I hope I can look back at it[n]with Rumi someday and feel nostalgic.[n][w][e]

[s]Apr. 9[n] [n]I just can't believe what's happened.[n]I'll never see Rumi's parents again...[n]I don't even know if Rumi will[n]ever come back to me.[n] [n]Her heart's been completely[n]closed off ever since that day.[n][w][e]
[s]Why did this happen?[n]What did Rumi do to deserve this?[n] [n]Do we really have to just go on[n]suffering these consequences?[n] [n]My headaches are getting worse—[n]I'm even starting to hear things.[n]Am I having some kind of breakdown?[n]I can't lose it... I have to do[n]something to help Rumi.[n] [n]No matter what it takes.[n][w][e]

[s]Aug. 23[n] [n]I still can't figure out what that[n]voice was in Rumi's room.[n] [n]Was it my subconscious? Was it...[n]it feels so strange writing this as a[n]scientist, but... was it some kind of[n]godlike being?[n] [n]I have no way to verify any[n]of these hypotheses...[n]it doesn't matter at this point.[n][w][e]
[s]All I know is that I've lost[n]Rumi and gained a strange[n]ability...[n] [n]and this ability will be my[n]key to the cognitive world.[n] [n]I believe this power[n]comes with a mission.[n] [n]My experiments must continue—[n]for all the people like Rumi.[n] [n]I must defy and improve this[n]atrocious world.[n][w][e]
[s]I have to face the truth...[n]I will never see Rumi again.[n] [n]If I interact with her, I could[n]trigger her memories and[n]all her grief would flood back.[n] [n]You may never hear this promise,[n]Rumi, but I swear—I will make you[n]a better reality.[n] [n]Thank you so much for everything.[n][w][e]

[s]June 3[n] [n]My thesis is progressing, bit by bit.[n] [n]The more research I perform,[n]the more I recognize the dangers[n]of cognitive psience.[n] [n]It's definitely contributed to my suspicions[n]over my research being shut down.[n] [n]No matter what, I must complete[n]my thesis as soon as possible.[n][w][e]
[s]My biggest problem is[n]my lack of research subjects.[n] [n]If only I could find some hint[n]about the cognitive world,[n]about this power I've received...[n] [n]I'm not giving up, funding or[n]no funding.[n] [n]I WILL complete my thesis.[n]I WILL save everyone.[n][w][e]

[s]Mar. 25[n] [n]A very interesting person[n]came for consultation today.[n] [n]She lost her older sister in an[n]accident and is now grief-stricken.[n] [n]I couldn't just sit there and[n]watch her suffer through her life.[n]The whole point of my research[n]is to save people like her.[n] [n]My experiments have taught me I can[n]change any cognition in my presence.[n][w][e]
[s]If she can't escape the guilt[n]and pain in her life, all I have to do[n]is make her believe she is her sister.[n] [n]That would be the most direct[n]and effective treatment option.[n] [n]That being said, I did[n]have to alter her cognition[n]quite a bit for the effect to succeed.[n] [n]This was my first time altering a[n]cognition so greatly. I should keep an[n]eye on her to see how things develop.[n][w][e]

[msg telop_005]
[s]Jan 1[n] [n]I've finally done it...[n]with greater results than ever expected.[n] [n]According to my data, reality and[n]the cognitive world are merging.[n] [n]It may be unbelievable, but...[n]I'm the one who did it.[n] [n]I never anticipated this, but[n]my theory is being proven with[n]reality as a whole.[n][w][e]
[s]I no longer need to meddle[n]with the cognitions of individuals.[n] [n]I can create the ideal reality[n]where no one ever suffers again.[n] [n]With this power I've been granted,[n]I shall lead the world to utopia.[n]This is the mission granted to me[n]by the people... by the world.[n][w][e]
[s]I'm sure he'll come around[n]to accepting it soon.[n] [n]Rumi, I'm so close...[n]so close to fulfilling my promise.[n] [n]In fact, I'll promise you again,[n]here and now: I will create[n]the perfect world for you.[n][w][e]
