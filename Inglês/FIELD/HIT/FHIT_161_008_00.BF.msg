[s]What's up with that smug self-satisfied[n]look on your faces? I don't like it...[n][w][e]
[s]The only reason you can act so grand is[n]that you live in a safe zone, devoid of[n]possible failure.[n][w][e]
[s]How does it feel to hear the truth?[n]Are you relieved to know you've been[n]fooling yourselves?[n][w][e]
[s]Now what I really can't understand is[n]what you call "happiness."[n][w][e]
[s]But whatever, I guess. Everyone has their[n]own way to reach it.[n][w][e]
[s]Either way, stop trying to tell us what[n]to do. This is how we can attain true[n]happiness.[n][w][e]
[s]I don't care what you guys think of it.[n]We have no reason to listen to your[n]complaints![n][w][e]

[s]The Phantom Thieves? I don't care if they[n]exist or not.[n][w][e]
[s]It was a fun joke while it lasted, but it's old[n]news now. Tell me something a little more[n]exciting.[n][w][e]

[s]Politics? Would taking an interest in[n]that really matter now? Nothing would[n]change...[n][w][e]
[s]I'd rather use that time for myself before[n]it's too late...[n][w][e]

[s]Reality is ending, right? There's no point[n]working hard now.[n][w][e]
[s]And my dreams...? I just have to deal with[n]never seeing them come true. It's a cruel[n]fact of life.[n][w][e]
