[msg MSG_CrossWord_Trivia04 [MALAISE]]
[s]In Japan, the May Blues are named as such due to[n]the change of seasons and the number of people[n]who fall ill after the long holiday at April's end.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CrossWord_Trivia06 [POLLENOSIS]]
[s]This is an allergic reaction that triggers when pollen[n]makes contact with membranes in the nose or eyes.[n]It primarily causes sneezing, runny nose, and itchiness.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CrossWord_Trivia07 [JAPANESE]]
[s]In contrast to imported Western art styles, paintings[n]produced post-1900 using techniques developed[n]within Japan are referred to as "Nihonga."[n][w][e]
[s]Foreigners visiting Japan during the Meiji period called[n]this "Japanese painting," which the literal Japanese[n]translate as "Nihon" (Japan) and "ga" (artwork).[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CrossWord_Trivia08 [MASTER]]
[s]Most often used in the phrase, "master of the arts," it's[n]reserved for artists with incredible skill and techniques[n]that grew to be heavily influential in their mediums.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CrossWord_Trivia11 [CURRENCY]]
[s]Originating from the Latin word "currentia" ("flowing"),[n]this term applies specifically to money, no matter the[n]medium—though it does not include checks or credit.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CrossWord_Trivia12 [FRONT]]
[s]When warm and cold air of equal force collide and stall,[n]the border is called a stationary front. When one lasts[n]from spring to summer, it's called a seasonal rain front.[n][w][e]
[s]This rainy season is called "tsuyu" in Japan, written with[n]the Chinese characters for plum and rain—possibly due[n]to how the rain constantly falls as the plums ripen.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_CrossWord_Trivia13 [NARCOTICS]]
[s]This term applies to any medicine that dulls the senses,[n]but is more often used as a generic term for both legal[n]and illegal drugs being misused.[n][w][e]
