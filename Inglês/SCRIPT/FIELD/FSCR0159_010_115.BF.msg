[s]Such boorish clothes. This is a pool,[n]you know. Go change into swimsuits[n]if you want to be here.[n][w][e]
[s]Let's sprawl out, gaze at the sky, and[n]waste the time away in leisurely paradise.[n][w][e]

[s]This place is great. No matter when I[n]come, I always find myself surrounded[n]by beautiful curves![n][w][e]
[s]Don't be embarrassed. That's the real[n]reason you're here too, is it not?[n][w][e]

[msg D159_10_npc_03_mes01 [Woman in a Swimsuit]]
[s]It has been so peaceful lately.[n][w][e]
[s]It's all thanks to Mr. Shido that we can[n]spend days in luxury like this! Hmhmhm![n][w][e]
