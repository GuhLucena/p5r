[s]...Oh, you have the elegance and[n]refinement so sorely lacking in the[n]ordinary citizenry![n][w][e]

[msg D07_01_e407_201_A_mes02 [Female Guest]]
[s]My, such flattery! A high-class aura[n]emanates from you as well![n][w][e]

[msg D07_01_e407_201_A_mes03 [Male Guest]]

[s]Hm...? One of the VIPs used to belong[n]to nobility?[n][w][e]

[msg D07_01_e407_201_B_mes02 [Male Guest]]
[s]Yes, that must be why he can enter the[n]sacred place. I heard he's not easily[n]seen either...[n][w][e]

[msg D07_01_e407_201_B_mes03 [Female Guest]]
[s]But why would someone of his stature[n]always be by the poolside?[n][w][e]

[msg D07_01_e407_201_B_mes04 [Male Guest]]

[s]Indeed. Mr. Shido has quite the large[n]circle of acquaintances.[n][w][e]
