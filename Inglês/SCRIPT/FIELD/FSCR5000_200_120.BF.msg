[s][clr 2](temp msg event)[clr 27][n]...Learn manpower tactics from a good[n]shogi player...?[n][w][e]

[msg HIHUMI_EV2ND_mes02 [Ryuji]]
[s]Well, sure, I guess it's not like no one[n]had thought of it before...[n][w][e]

[msg HIHUMI_EV2ND_mes03 [Ann]]
[s]But it just might work for us.[n][w][e]
[s]You need a lot of brains to play shogi, no?[n][w][e]

[msg HIHUMI_EV2ND_mes04 [Yusuke]]
[s]Formations, sequences, what to do with[n]members in waiting... There is certainly[n]common ground in how we fight.[n][w][e]

[msg HIHUMI_EV2ND_mes05 [Morgana]]
[s]It's a good idea, coming from[n][f 4 2].[n][w][e]

[msg HIHUMI_EV2ND_mes06 [Ann]]
[s]...But I doubt if any of us are conveniently[n]acquainted with a shogi expert.[n][w][e]

[msg HIHUMI_EV2ND_mes07 [Ryuji]]
[s]Yeah, that.[n][w][e]

[msg HIHUMI_EV2ND_mes08 [Yusuke]]
[s]Acquainted, perhaps not. But I do have[n]exactly one lead.[n][w][e]

[msg HIHUMI_EV2ND_mes09 [Ryuji]]
[s]Whoa, I wasn't expectin' that![n][w][e]

[msg HIHUMI_EV2ND_mes10 [Yusuke]]
[s]She is a student at Kosei like me.[n]I think her name is Hifumi Shindo.[n][w][e]
[s]She's a goodâ€” Well, she's apparently[n]a professional shogi player.[n][w][e]

[msg HIHUMI_EV2ND_mes11 [Ryuji]]
[s]You guys got some interestin' characters[n]at your school![n][w][e]
[s]So, can we count her to work with us?[n][w][e]

[msg HIHUMI_EV2ND_mes12 [Yusuke]]
[s]Who knows? Perhaps if a deal can be[n]struck with her.[n][w][e]

[msg HIHUMI_EV2ND_mes13 [Ryuji]]
[s]What, you can't just bring her here?[n][w][e]

[msg HIHUMI_EV2ND_mes14 [Yusuke]]
[s]I don't know her. Never even talked to her.[n]I have heard that she is a bit odd.[n][w][e]
[s]But I do not think my relationship with[n]her matters in this case.[n][w][e]
[s]It's our fearless leader, [f 4 1],[n]who has to learn the tactics, after all.[n][w][e]
[s]I think [f 4 1] should directly[n]contact Togo and negotiate with her.[n][w][e]

[msg HIHUMI_EV2ND_mes15 [Ryuji]]
[s]Hm. Yeah, I guess you're right...[n][w][e]
[s]Whaddya wanna do, [f 4 2]?[n][w][e]

[sel HIHUMI_EV2ND_SEL01 top]
[s]I'll meet with her.[e]
[s]I'll look into it.[e]

[msg HIHUMI_EV2ND_A_mes01 [Yusuke]]
[s]That's why you're the leader. Things[n]move so swiftly with you.[n][w][e]

[msg HIHUMI_EV2ND_B_mes01 [Yusuke]]
[s]Not that we are sure to learn any tactics[n]from her, but perhaps the sooner the[n]better.[n][w][e]

[msg HIHUMI_EV2ND_mes16 [Yusuke]]
[s]I hear Togo walks around Shibuya in[n]her school uniform.[n][w][e]
[s]Most shogi players are not known to be[n]visibly striking, which makes finding her[n]admittedly difficult...[n][w][e]
[s]But if you get a vibe from someone,[n]you should try talking to them.[n][w][e]
