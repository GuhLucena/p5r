[s][bup 0 4 100 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][f 4 25 1 65535 0 0]Uh, there's a guard there...[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][f 4 25 1 65535 0 0]It ought to go the same as when you hide[n]and jump on an enemy. Give it a shot.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 0 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][f 4 25 1 65535 0 0]Shadows have emotions too, you know.[n]Of course they'll be afraid if you corner[n]them like that.[n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][f 4 25 1 65535 0 0]It might be worth purposely creating such[n]situations to get them begging for their lives.[n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][f 4 25 1 65535 0 0]The Shadows seem to have different[n]attitudes, too. If we take advantage of that,[n]negotiations may go more smoothly.[n][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 1 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][f 4 25 1 65535 0 0]I'll try to let you know what kind of answers[n]the Shadows want to hear, depending[n]on their personalities.[n][w][e]
