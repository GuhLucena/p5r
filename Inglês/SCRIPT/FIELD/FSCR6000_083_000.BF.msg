[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]The idea that I could fight the whole world,[n]that's what got me through all that rough[n]training.[n][w][e]

[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]I had decent win rates, but I could never[n]win a tournament.[n][w][e]

[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]I wouldn't be able to remain a pro due to[n]financial issues. That's when I was told[n]there was another way to make money...[n][w][e]
