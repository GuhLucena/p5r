[s]Our marksmanship lacks finesse.[n][w][e]
[s]Yeah, it's too... blunt.[n][w][e]

[msg SHINYA_EV_mes02 [Ryuji]]
[s]The hell you talkin' about?[n][w][e]

[msg SHINYA_EV_mes03 [Ann]]
[s]I had a thought while watching[n]"Doronko Billy" the other day.[n][w][e]
[s]Do you know what trick shooting is?[n][w][e]

[msg SHINYA_EV_mes04 [Yusuke]]
[s]You mean like shooting a vase off[n]someone's head or a plate out of the air?[n][w][e]
[s]What's the point of doing that during[n]a real fight?[n][w][e]

[msg SHINYA_EV_mes05 [Ann]]
[s]Well, I don't mean we should put on a[n]show or anything...[n][w][e]
[s]But maybe we should learn to shoot with[n]precision instead of just firing at enemies.[n][w][e]

[msg SHINYA_EV_mes06 [Morgana]]
[s]Not a bad idea, Lady Ann.[n][w][e]
[s]If we improve our marksmanship,[n]we'll stand a better chance at hitting[n]an enemy's vitals.[n][w][e]
[s]Or, we can wound enemies in specific[n]ways.[n][w][e]
[s]Like immobilizing them, as opposed to[n]just doing damage.[n][w][e]

[msg SHINYA_EV_mes07 [Yusuke]]
[s]We could keep them alive to lure out[n]a rescue team.[n][w][e]

[msg SHINYA_EV_mes08 [Ryuji]]
[s]Well, when you put it that way, Ann[n]might be on to somethin'.[n][w][e]
[s]Good luck finding a way to up your[n]shootin' skills, [f 4 2].[n][w][e]

[sel SHINYA_EV_SEL01 top]
[s]You're dumping this on me?[e]
[s]Why me?[e]

[msg SHINYA_EV_mes09 [Ryuji]]
[s]...I use a shotgun.[n][w][e]

[msg SHINYA_EV_mes10 [Ann]]
[s]I use a submachine gun.[n][w][e]

[msg SHINYA_EV_mes11 [Yusuke]]
[s]And I use an assault rifle.[n][w][e]
[s]You're the only one who uses a gun[n]that's good for trick shooting.[n][w][e]

[msg SHINYA_EV_mes12 [Morgana]]
[s]It'll be a useful skill for you, so let's see[n]if we can't find ways to improve your[n]marksmanship.[n][w][e]
