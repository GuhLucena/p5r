[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes01 [Morgana]]
[s]Oh yeah... Now that we'll be visiting[n]Mementos, I should talk about the[n]weather.[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes02 [Ryuji]]
[s]What? The weather? What about the[n]weather?[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes03 [Morgana]]
[s]You should know that Mementos and[n]Palaces are influenced by the weather[n]in this world.[n][w][e]
[s]To be more specific, when a person's[n]mood changes as a result of the weather,[n]it impacts Shadows in the Metaverse.[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes04 [Ryuji]]
[s]Huh? The heck are you talkin' about?[n]How does the weather mess things up[n]like that?[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes05 [Morgana]]
[s]Do you ever have those days when[n]you're feeling down because the[n]weather is bad?[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes06 [Ryuji]]
[s]Hm? Do I?[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes07 [Ann]]
[s]Yeah, I can relate to that.[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes08 [Morgana]]
[s]That feeling, however small, influences[n]the way that person sees the world.[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes9 [Ann]]
[s]Oh... So it's our cognition that changes,[n]is that right?[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes10 [Morgana]]
[s]That's my Lady Ann. You're so sharp,[n]unlike some doofus I know...[n][w][e]
[s]Anyway, the weather has an impact on[n]lots of people and, therefore, it also has[n]an impact on Mementos and Palaces.[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes11 [Ryuji]]
[s]Naw, naw, naw, wait a minute. You're[n]talking about the stupid WEATHER, right?[n][w][e]
[s]We've had days where the weather[n]wasn't great. Did that have an impact[n]on the other world?[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes12 [Morgana]]
[s]Well, maybe nothing too dramatic, but[n]there was still an effect, especially on the[n]Shadows.[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes13 [Ann]]
[s]On the Shadows?[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes14 [Morgana]]
[s]When the weather is bad in this world,[n]you might see rare Shadows.[n][w][e]
[s]They're called Treasure Demons.[n]And they're not usually in Mementos[n]or Palaces.[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes15 [Ryuji]]
[s]...Really?[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes16 [Morgana]]
[s]With Palaces, our target's preferences[n]come into play as well.[n][w][e]
[s]Like if the target doesn't like thunder,[n]a storm on our side would have a[n]tremendous impact on the Palace.[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes17 [Ryuji]]
[s]And that's when the rare ones come out?[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes18 [Morgana]]
[s]Yes, but in the Palaces that's not all. It can[n]also cause more Shadows to appear, and[n]even impacts the treasures you can find.[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes19 [Ann]]
[s]And all that is dependent on the[n]cognition of the Palace's master...[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes20 [Ryuji]]
[s]Hmm...[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes21 [Morgana]]
[s]You're not getting any of this, are you?[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes22 [Ryuji]]
[s]Well, wait, so is it a good idea to go to[n]the Metaverse when the weather is bad?[n]Or is it a bad idea?[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes23 [Morgana]]
[s]I think it's a good idea! Rare Shadows[n]can sometimes drop rare items.[n][w][e]
[s]Battles will also give you more[n]experience, and that'll lead to your[n]increased growth.[n][w][e]
[s]I don't know what kind of changes will[n]happen in the Palace, but maybe we'll be[n]able to acquire something really nice...[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes24 [Ryuji]]
[s]So you recommend it?[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes25 [Morgana]]
[s]Well, that's just my take on it. Whether to[n]go or not, I'll leave that up to our leader.[n][w][e]
[s]Just keep in mind that bad weather in[n]our world has an impact on Mementos[n]and Palaces.[n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes26 [Ryuji]]
[s]You should tell us these important things[n]sooner, you dumb cat![n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes27 [Morgana]]
[s]Nya!? I told you just now![n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes28 [Ryuji]]
[s]Yeah, but you shoulda told us sooner![n][w][e]

[msg WEATHER_TUTO_mes29 [Morgana]]
[s]Hmph![n][w][e]
