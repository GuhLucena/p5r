[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]I want to save people's lives. And I want[n]to do something great, and help make[n]medical history.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]But I'm just a mediocre doctor. I've[n]only gotten promoted because of my[n]university connections.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Takemi, though, was so creative. She had[n]all these ideas, and her techniques were[n]extraordinary...![n][w][e]

[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]I thought she wouldn't recover, so I[n]moved her to the hospice wing for[n]terminally ill patients.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]But that patient didn't believe my[n]diagnosis. She ended up transferring[n]to another hospital.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]Of course, transferring to another[n]hospital makes our own hospital[n]and university look really bad.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]That's why I made everyone tell the same[n]lie: the patient chose to leave the hospice,[n]and then died.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]She doesn't have much time left, but[n]maybe Takemi could do something[n]about it.[n][w][e]

[msg MND_009_0_0]
[s][vp 1 0 0 0 0 0]It sounds like the patient[n]is still alive. I should go tell[n]Takemi about this right away...[n][w][e]
