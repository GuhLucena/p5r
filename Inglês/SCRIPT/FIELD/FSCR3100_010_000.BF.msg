[s]Doesn't that mean not to touch it because[n]it's for the cafe?[n][w][e]
[s]Though, if someone tells you not to do[n]something, it just makes you want to do[n]it even more...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_EatParamLock_moru [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 3 0 0]Wait, you're not going to eat it? You've got[n]to have more [f 4 11 3][clr 26][f 4 12 3][clr 27] than that.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_LetterNum_01 [Note from Sojiro]]

[msg MSG_LetterNum_02 [Note from Sojiro]]
[s]"You ate some of the cafe's food again,[n]didn't you? Didn't you notice the Leblanc[n]sticker?"[n][w][e]
[s]"Don't touch anything that has[n]'LEBLANC' written on it. Got it?"[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_LetterNum_03 [Note from Sojiro]]

[msg MSG_LetterNum_04 [Note from Sojiro]]
[s]"You did it again, didn't you? Was it good?"[n][w][e]
[s]"The one you ate was actually poisoned.[n]You only have about three days to live."[n][w][e]
[s]"...Not really, but don't blame me if[n]something happens next time. Stop[n]eating the cafe's food."[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_LetterNum_05 [Note from Sojiro]]
[s]"It's starting to become a hassle to write[n]one of these every time you steal food."[n][w][e]
[s]"This is your last warning!"[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_LetterNum_06 [Note from Sojiro]]
[s]"I thought last time would be the last one,[n]but I decided to write another one, after all."[n][w][e]
[s]"Once you make it in life, you're gonna pay[n]me back for all the stuff you ate. Got it?"[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_LetterAbout_moru [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 1 0 0]That's what it says.[n][w][e]
[s]But it's in a phantom thief's nature to steal[n]something when it's more difficult to take![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_LetterAbout]
[s]It looks like I got[n]caught stealing food...[n][w][e]
