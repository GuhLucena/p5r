[s]There are a lot of books just piled up[n]haphazardly here...[n][w][e]

[msg SHELF_CLEAN_NG_TEACHER]
[s]I should be able to use the[n]shelves if I organize the books.[n][w][e]
[s]I can't handle this all on my own,[n]though. Maybe if I asked some[n]kind of cleaning professional...[n][w][e]

[msg SHELF_CLEAN_NG_mes01]
[s]I'm too tired to clean...[n][w][e]

[msg SHELF_CLEAN_MENU]
[s]I might be able to put something[n]here if I clean up a bit.[n][w][e]
[s]Should I spend some time cleaning?[n][w][e]

[s]A couple of books in this[n]pile of mostly old magazines[n]look pretty interesting...[n][w][e]
[s][clr 4]"Fun Single Life"[clr 27] and[n][clr 4]"Having Fun in Shibuya"[clr 27]...[n][w][e]
[s]These might have some good[n]information that'll help me[n]live on my own in the big city...[n][w][e]
[s]If I want to read them, I could[n]probably concentrate on them[n]better at the counter in Leblanc.[n][w][e]

[msg SHELF_CLEAN_ITEM_GET]
[s]You obtained [clr 4]"Fun Single Life"[clr 27][n]and [clr 4]"Having Fun in Shibuya"[clr 27].[n][w][e]

[msg SHELF_CLEAN_mes02]
[s]These shelves seem[n]a little more organized now.[n][w][e]

[msg SHELF_CLEAN_PARAM_UP]
[s]Organizing that pile of magazines[n]without knocking it over increased[n]my [clr 1]cleverness[clr 27]![n][w][e]

[msg SHELF_CLEAN_END_mes01]
[s]I could probably put something here.[n][w][e]
[s]Once things calm down, maybe[n]I can buy some [clr 2]furniture[clr 27]...[n][w][e]

[msg SHELF_CLEAN_END_mes02 [Morgana]]
[s]Since you cleaned this shelf, it would be nice[n]to put something on it...[n][w][e]
[s]This room is pretty bland, but all this quiet[n]makes it feel kind of gloomy...[n][w][e]
[s]Oh, I know! Having a [clr 2]CD player[clr 27] here would[n]be quite nice.[n][w][e]
[s]If you put on some music on while you train[n]yourself, getting in the rhythm may make it[n]more effective.[n][w][e]
[s]Okay, let's look for a [clr 2]CD player[clr 27] so we can[n]put it on the shelf.[n][w][e]

[msg SHELF_CLEAN_END_CD [Morgana]]
[s]I think it'd be good to put the [clr 2]CD player[clr 27] you[n]have on this shelf.[n][w][e]
[s]Do you want to put the [clr 2]CD player[clr 27] on the[n]table?[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_SHELF_CLEAN_END_CD top]
[s]Sure, let's do that.[e]
[s]No, not really.[e]

[msg SHELF_CLEAN_END_CD_OK [Morgana]]
[s]All right! Let's set it up![n][w][e]

[msg SHELF_CLEAN_END_CD_NO [Morgana]]
[s]You're not going to do it? Just so you know,[n]you can only put the TV on this table![n][w][e]

[msg SHELF_CLEAN_END_mes03]
[s]I should get to bed...[n][w][e]
