[msg SPOT_TUTO_BEFORE_MORU01 [Morgana]]
[s]Hey, I have something I[n]need to talk to you about![n][w][e]
[s]Take a seat on the sofa.[n]There's good news![n][w][e]

[msg SPOT_TUTO_BEFORE_MORU02 [Morgana]]
[s]So, the good news is...[n][w][e]
[s]I found this in the trash can[n]in Leblanc.[n][w][e]

[msg SPOT_TUTO_BEFORE_MORU03]
[s]"Hot Date Spots"...? It's a page[n]torn from a magazine.[n][w][e]

[msg SPOT_TUTO_BEFORE_MORU04 [Morgana]]
[s]It might just look like a[n]scrap of paper, but there's[n]some interesting info in there.[n][w][e]
[s]Let's see here...[n][w][e]
[s]"Come to the Ichigaya Fishing Pond[n]for some quiet relaxation"... Hm,[n]it's talking about a fishing pond.[n][w][e]
[s]"Unwavering Deliciousness: Indulge[n]in Ogikubo's Famous Ramen"... Ooh,[n]this one is for a ramen shop.[n][w][e]

[msg SPOT_TUTO_BEFORE_MORU05]
[s]A fishing pond and ramen shop...[n][w][e]

[msg SPOT_TUTO_BEFORE_MORU06 [Morgana]]
[s]Now, here's the important part.[n][w][e]
[s]If you want to be a strong[n]phantom thief, you can't stay[n]cooped up inside your shell.[n][w][e]
[s]In other words, you need to[n]explore the city and expand[n]your sphere of knowledge.[n][w][e]
[s]You have the day off today, so[n]now's a good time to go out.[n][w][e]
[s]Let's try going to the fishing[n]pond or the ramen shop![n][w][e]

[msg SPOT_TUTO_RYUJI_INVITE00]
[s]I got a message from Ryuji.[n][w][e]

[msg SPOT_TUTO_RYUJI_INVITE00_2 [Morgana]]
[s]"Yo, I wanna do some fishing.[n]Let's head over to Ichigaya!"[n][w][e]
[s]He seems like he's in a hurry.[n][w][e]
[s]Not a bad idea, though. New[n]experiences are important[n]for a phantom thief.[n][w][e]
[s]And the best way to do that[n]is by going somewhere new![n]Well, let's go to Ichigaya![n][w][e]

[msg SPOT_TUTO_RYUJI_INVITE00_3]
[s]I guess I should go...[n][w][e]

[msg SPOT_TUTO_RYUJI_INVITE00_4 [Morgana]]
[s]By the way... do you even[n]know how to get to Ichigaya?[n][w][e]
[s]That look you're giving me[n]says no. Hold on. I think it[n]should be around here...[n][w][e]

[msg SPOT_TUTO_RYUJI_INVITE00_5 [Morgana]]
[s]There! That's a map of train[n]lines, so you can think about[n]how to get to Ichigaya.[n][w][e]
[s]By the way, you'll need to[n]take the Chuo Sobu Line.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_NIGHT_0508_000 [Morgana]]
[s]Phew. Good work.[n][w][e]
[s]See? By going to different places,[n]you can have new experiences.[n][w][e]
[s]But you can't just go anywhere.[n]It has to be somewhere that will[n]sharpen your thief senses.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_TUTORIAL_SPOT [Exploring the City]]
[s]You can head out into the city[n][clr 2]during the day[clr 27] on [clr 2]days off[clr 27].[n][w][e]
[s]This will help you train[n]and expand your knowledge.[n][w][e]
[s]If you go with a friend, you can[n]even deepen your relationship. You[n]should try to do this proactively.[n][w][e]
[s]When you want to go out, either[n]check the [clr 2]train map[clr 27] in your[n]room or open the [clr 2]big map[clr 27].[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_NIGHT_0508_001 [Morgana]]
[s]This time, you learned about[n]the [clr 4]fishing pond[clr 27] because of[n]Ryuji's invitation.[n][w][e]
[s]But from now on, you'll have to[n]find new hangout spots yourself.[n]Why not buy a guidebook?[n][w][e]
[s]You can try listening to what[n]people are saying in town too![n][w][e]

[msg MSG_NIGHT_0508_002]
[s]A guidebook... They might sell one[n]of those at the bookstore.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_NIGHT_0508_003 [Morgana]]
[s]It's already late today.[n]I should get some rest.[n][w][e]
