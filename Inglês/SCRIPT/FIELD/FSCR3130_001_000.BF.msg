[s]You know, if you read some books at this[n]counter... You would look really cool.[n][w][e]
[s]Getting lost in a book at a quiet caf√©,[n]surrounded by the smell of coffee...[n][w][e]
[s]I suppose you can consider this one[n]of the benefits of living here.[n][w][e]
[s]When the chief's not around, you can[n]spend your time here, reading in elegance![n][w][e]
[s]...Wait, you don't even have any books.[n][w][e]
[s]I think there's a big bookstore on[n]Central Street in Shibuya.[n][w][e]
[s]Why don't you go check it out sometime?[n][w][e]

[msg MND_BOOK_NO_OPEN]
[s]The counter is old, but well-maintained.[n][w][e]
[s]The faint smell of coffee and[n]the perfect amount of lighting[n]create a calm atmosphere.[n][w][e]
[s]This just might be the perfect[n]place to do some reading.[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_DUMMY_01]
[s]This counter is cleaner and nicer[n]than I thought...[n][w][e]
[s]It actually might be more[n]relaxing here compared to[n]my room on the second floor.[n][w][e]
[s]Maybe I'll use this area[n]if I want to [clr 2]eat[clr 27] or [clr 2]read[clr 27]...[n][w][e]
