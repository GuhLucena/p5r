[s]Would you shut UP! If you're talking back[n]like that, that means you must be an otaku[n]too![n][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 1 46661 65535 0]Otakus should be erased from this world![n][w][e]

[s]My parents cried when I failed my entrance[n]exam.[n][w][e]
[s]They blamed it on me being an otaku...[n]I took those words to heart.[n][w][e]
[s]I was hurt because I was an otaku. If I[n]weren't an otaku, I wouldn't have gotten[n]hurt.[n][w][e]
[s]But my friend passed the exams, so I should[n]have known deep down that it wasn't true.[n][w][e]
[s][vp 8 2 1 46665 65535 0]I ignored the truth. I'm such an idiot...[n][w][e]

[msg MSG_QST_075_07 [Shadow Oi]]
[s][vp 8 2 1 46667 65535 0]Yeah. First... I'm gonna go apologize to that[n]friend.[n][w][e]
[s]I don't know if I'll be forgiven, but it's worth[n]a try.[n][w][e]

[s][vp 8 2 1 46668 65535 0]I know.[n][w][e]
[s]My parents are gonna cry again... But that's[n]just the way it has to be.[n][w][e]
[s]It wasn't about whether I was an otaku[n]or not. It was about me being an idiot...[n][w][e]
